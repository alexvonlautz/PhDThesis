      \field{abstract}{An important difference between magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) is that MEG is insensitive to radially oriented sources. We quantified computationally the dependency of MEG and EEG on the source orientation using a forward model with realistic tissue boundaries. Similar to the simpler case of a spherical head model, in which MEG cannot see radial sources at all, for most cortical locations there was a source orientation to which MEG was insensitive. The median value for the ratio of the signal magnitude for the source orientation of the lowest and the highest sensitivity was 0.06 for MEG and 0.63 for EEG. The difference in the sensitivity to the source orientation is expected to contribute to systematic differences in the signal-to-noise ratio between MEG and EEG.}

      \field{abstract}{The anatomical and functional organization of the inferior parietal lobule was investigated in macaque monkeys by using anterograde and retrograde anatomical tracing techniques and single cell recording techniques in awake, behaving monkeys. The connections of areas 7a and 7b, and of two previously unexplored areas, the lateral intraparietal area (LIP) and the dorsal prelunate area (DP), were examined in detail. Functional mapping experiments were performed in all four areas. Prior to this study the pathways for visual input to area 7a were unclear. In these experiments we found several direct projections from extrastriate visual areas, including the lateral intraparietal (LIP), dorsal prelunate (DP), parieto-occipital (PO), and medial superior temporal (MST) areas into area 7a. Using the observed laminar patterns of connections between areas 7a, LIP, and DP and other extrastriate cortical areas, we were able to construct a hypothetical flow of visual information processing from striate cortex to area 7a. A broader hierarchy was also produced, which relates the positions of areas 7a, 7b, LIP, and DP to various cortical fields in the parietal, temporal, and frontal lobes. By combining single cell recording techniques in trained monkeys with anatomical tracing techniques, we have parceled the inferior parietal lobule into several subdivisions on the basis of both anatomical and physiological grounds. A clear segregation of visual and somatosensory responses was found in the inferior parietal lobule with areas 7a, LIP, and DP being visual and visual-motor and area 7b being primarily somatosensory. A similar segregation was found anatomically with areas 7a, LIP, and DP being interconnected primarily with other visual cortical areas and area 7b being connected with several somatosensory areas. Area 7b was also found to connect to a few visual cortical areas, and these connections likely account for the small but consistent number of visually responsive cells that are found in this region. Areas LIP, DP, and 7a differed in receptive field and saccade-related properties. Area 7a visual receptive fields were very large and usually bilateral with a small but significant number of them having receptive field centers in the ipsilateral visual field. Area DP and LIP receptive fields were smaller and the receptive field peaks were almost always confined to the contralateral visual field. Areas 7a, DP, and LIP all contained cells with saccade-related responses; however, in area 7a there were fewer saccade cells than area LIP, and presaccadic responses were only observed in area LIP.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)}

      \field{abstract}{It has long been appreciated that the posterior parietal cortex plays a role in the processing of saccadic eye movements. Only recently has it been discovered that a small cortical area, the lateral intraparietal area, within this much larger area appears to be specialized for saccadic eye movements. Unlike other cortical areas in the posterior parietal cortex, the lateral intraparietal area has strong anatomical connections to other saccade centers, and its cells have saccade-related responses that begin before the saccades. The lateral intraparietal area appears to be neither a strictly visual nor strictly motor structure; rather it performs visuomotor integration functions including determining the spatial location of saccade targets and forming plans to make eye movements. {©} 1992.}

      \field{abstract}{The posterior parietal cortex (PPC), historically believed to be a sensory structure, is now viewed as an area important for sensory-motor integration. Among its functions is the forming of intentions, that is, high-level cognitive plans for movement. There is a map of intentions within the PPC, with different subregions dedicated to the planning of eye movements, reaching movements, and grasping movements. These areas appear to be specialized for the multisensory integration and coordinate transformations required to convert sensory input to motor output. In several subregions of the PPC, these operations are facilitated by the use of a common distributed space representation that is independent of both sensory input and motor output. Attention and learning effects are also evident in the PPC. However, these effects may be general to cortex and operate in the PPC in the context of sensory-motor transformations.}

      \field{abstract}{Behavioral and clinical studies have long implicated the posterior parietal cortex of primates in spatial perception and spatially oriented behavior. However, recordings from single neurons in behaving monkeys by different laboratories have resulted in divergent views with some ascribing a largely motor and others a largely sensory role for this region. We have designed paradigms to separate the sensory and motor components of the neural activity and have found that the cells in this area respond to both sensory stimulation and motor behavior. Thus, it is likely that this area is not solely sensory or motor, but rather is involved in higher order aspects of sensory-motor integration.}

      \field{abstract}{Neural oscillations with a frequency of around 10 Hz are thought to be a ubiquitous phenomenon in sensory cortices, and it has been hypothesized that the level of 10 Hz activity is related to local cortical excitability. During spatial attention, the visual alpha rhythm has been found to be modulated according to the direction of attention. Specifically, the alpha rhythm desynchronizes over visual cortex contralateral to the direction of attention and synchronizes over visual cortex ipsilateral to the direction of attention, and these modulations have been associated with facilitation and inhibition of sensory processing. In the somatosensory domain, the reactivity of a similar rhythm, known as the mu rhythm, during attention tasks is a current topic of inquiry and somatotopic modulation of the mu rhythm by directed attention have been reported. In this paper, we investigate how lateralized spatial attention modulates the ongoing somatosensory mu rhythm, and how such modulation impacts sensory information processing. 128 channel EEG was recorded while subjects performed a somatosensory spatial attention task. In addition to analyses on scalp recorded data, a spatial filtering method was utilized to investigate spatial attention effects in the source space. The direction of spatial attention was found to have a significant somatotopic effect on the ongoing mu rhythm occurring in primary somatosensory cortex. Concurrently, the visual alpha rhythm was significantly elevated above the baseline level during somatosensory attention, demonstrating a cross-modal effect. Lastly, an analysis was performed to investigate the correlation between the level of prestimulus mu activity and subsequent stimulus evoked activity in primary somatosensory cortex. {©} 2011 IBRO.}

      \field{abstract}{Categorization has been associated with distributed networks of the primate brain, including the prefrontal (PFC) and posterior parietal cortices (PPC). Although category-selective spiking in PFC and PPC has been established, the frequency-dependent dynamic interactions of frontoparietal networks are largely unexplored. We trained monkeys to perform a delayed-match-to-spatial-category task while recording spikes and local field potentials from the PFC and PPC with multiple electrodes. We found category-selective beta- and delta-band synchrony between and within the areas. However, in addition to the categories, delta synchrony and spiking activity also reflected irrelevant stimulus dimensions. By contrast, beta synchrony only conveyed information about the task-relevant categories. Further, category-selective PFC neurons were synchronized with PPC beta oscillations, while neurons that carried irrelevant information were not. These results suggest that long-range beta-band synchrony could act as a filter that only supports neural representations of the variables relevant to the task at hand.}

      \field{abstract}{Many theories of perception are anchored in the central notion that the brain continuously updates an internal model of the world to infer the probable causes of sensory events. In this framework, the brain needs not only to predict the causes of sensory input, but also when they are most likely to happen. In this article, we review the neurophysiological bases of sensory predictions of "what' (predictive coding) and 'when' (predictive timing), with an emphasis on low-level oscillatory mechanisms. We argue that neural rhythms offer distinct and adapted computational solutions to predicting 'what' is going to happen in the sensory environment and 'when'. {©} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.}

      \field{abstract}{This article reports 3 experiments that tested a hypothesis regarding the nature of rehearsal in spatial working memory, one in which discrete shifts of spatial selective attention mediate the maintenance of location-specific representations. Experiment 1 demonstrated increases in visual processing efficiency for locations held in working memory, which suggested that attention was oriented toward these locations. Experiment 2 eliminated key alternative explanations for Experiment 1 by using an identical stimulus display with a nonspatial memory task, and little or no facilitation of processing at memorized locations was found under these conditions. Finally, Experiment 3 showed that spatial working memory was impaired when participants were hindered in their ability to attend to memorized locations. It is argued that these results implicate selective spatial attention as a rehearsal mechanism for spatial working memory.}

      \field{abstract}{1. The response properties of 354 single neurons in the medial (M), dorsomedial (DM), dorsolateral (DL), and middle temporal (MT) visual areas were studied quantitatively with bar, spot, and random-dot stimuli in chronically implanted owl monkeys with fixed gaze. 2. A directionality index was computed to compare the responses to stimuli in the optimal direction with the responses to the opposing direction of movement. The greater the difference between opposing directions, the higher the index. MT cells had much higher direction indices to moving bars than cells in DL, DM, and M. 3. A tuning index was computed for each cell to compare the responses to bars moving in the optimal direction, or flashed in the optimal orientation, with the responses in other directions or orientations within +/- 90 degrees. Cells in all four areas were more sharply tuned to the orientation of stationary flashed bars than to moving bars, although a few cells (9/92( were unresponsive in the absence of movement. DM cells tended to be more sharply tuned to moving bars than cells in the other areas. 4. Directionality in DM, DL, and MT was relatively unaffected by the use of single-spot stimuli instead of bars; tuning in all four areas was broader to spots than bars. 5. Moving arrays of randomly spaced spots were more strongly excitatory than bar stimuli for many neurons in MT (16/31 cells). These random-dot stimuli were also effective in M, but evoked no response or weak responses from most cells in DM and DL. 6. The best velocities of movement were usually in the range of 10-100 degrees/s, although a few cells (22/227), primarily in MT (14/69 cells), preferred higher velocities. 7. Receptive fields of neurons in all four areas were much larger than striate receptive fields. Eccentricity was positively correlated with receptive-field size (r = 0.62), but was not correlated with directionality index, tuning index, or best velocity. 8. The results support the hypothesis that there are specializations of function among the cortical visual areas.}

      \field{abstract}{Comparing two sequentially presented stimuli is a widely used experimental paradigm for studying working memory. The delay activity of many single neurons in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of monkeys was found to be stimulus-specific, however, population dynamics of stimulus representation has not been elucidated. We analyzed the population state of a large number of PFC neurons during a somatosensory discrimination task. Using the tuning curves of the neurons, we derived a compact characterization of the population state. Stimulus representation by the population was found to degrade after stimulus termination, and emerge in a different form toward the end of the delay. Specifically, the tuning properties of neurons were found to change during the task. We suggest a mechanism whereby information about the stimulus is contained in activity-dependent synaptic facilitation of recurrent connections.}

      \field{abstract}{1. The cortex of the inferior parietal lobule (IPL) contains neurons whose activity is related to saccadic eye movements. The exact role of the IPL in relation to saccades remains, however, unclear. In this and the companion paper, we approach this problem by quantifying many of the spatial and temporal parameters of the saccade-related (S) activity. These parameters have hitherto been largely unstudied. 2. The activity of single neurons was recorded from Macaca mulatta monkeys while they were performing a delayed-saccade task. The analysis presented here is based on 161 neurons recorded from the lateral intraparietal area (LIP), a recently defined subdivision of the IPL; and 54 neurons recorded from the neighboring part of the IPL, area 7a. Overall, 409 IPL neurons were isolated in this study. 3. The typical activity of IPL neurons during the delayed-saccade task has three basic phases: light sensitive (LS), memory (M), and S. These basic phases are common to neurons of both areas LIP and 7a. In each phase (LS, M, and S), individual neurons may or may not be active. Most LIP neurons, however, are active in more than one phase. 4. To compare the activity levels of different neurons, the actual firing rate was weighted by each neuron's background level, yielding an "activity index" for each neuron, in each phase of the task. We calculated the activity index for the LS and M phases and for three phases related to the saccade: a presaccadic (Pre-S), a saccade-coincident (S-Co), and a postsaccadic (Post-S) phase. For area LIP neurons the median values of the activity index were high for the LS, M, Pre-S, and S-Co activities, and slightly lower in the Post-S period. In area 7a the median values were low for the LS phase and, in particular, for the M and Pre-S phases, somewhat higher coincident with the saccade, and high post-saccadically. 5. In area LIP, in each phase, 49-63{\%} of the neurons had excitatory activity, and 10-17{\%} had inhibitory responses. 6. In contrast, in area 7a excitatory responses were most frequent in the Post-S phase (56{\%}). Excitation was particularly infrequent during M (28{\%}) and Pre-S (22{\%}). The incidence of inhibitory responses varied too (4-18{\%}). The time course of inhibition was roughly opposite that of excitation; the highest frequency of inhibitory responses occurred during the saccade.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)}

      \field{abstract}{Visual cortical areas subserve cognitive functions byinteracting in both feedforward and feedback directions. While feedforward influences convey sensory signals, feedback influences modulate feedforward signaling according to the current behavioral context. We investigated whether these interareal influences are subserved differentially by rhythmic synchronization. We correlated frequency-specific directed influences among 28 pairs of visual areas with anatomical metrics of the feedforward or feedback character of the respective interareal projections. This revealed that in the primate visual system, feedforward influences are carried by theta-band ({\~{}}4Hz) and gamma-band ({\~{}}60-80Hz) synchronization, and feedback influences by beta-band ({\~{}}14-18Hz) synchronization. The functional directed influences constrain a functional hierarchy similar to the anatomical hierarchy, but exhibiting task-dependent dynamic changes in particular with regard tothehierarchical positions of frontal areas. Our results demonstrate that feedforward and feedback signaling use distinct frequency channels, suggesting that they subserve differential communication requirements.}

      \field{abstract}{We investigated the effects of spatial-selective attention on oscillatory neuronal dynamics in a tactile delayed-match-to-sample task. Whole-head magnetoencephalography was recorded in healthy subjects while dot patterns were presented to their index fingers using Braille stimulators. The subjects' task was to report the reoccurrence of an initially presented sample pattern in a series of up to eight test stimuli that were presented unpredictably to their right or left index finger. Attention was cued to one side (finger) at the beginning of each trial, and subjects performed the task at the attended side, ignoring the unattended side. After stimulation, high-frequency gamma-band activity (60-95 Hz) in presumed primary somatosensory cortex (S1) was enhanced, whereas alpha- and beta-band activity were suppressed in somatosensory and occipital areas and then rebounded. Interestingly, despite the absence of any visual stimulation, we also found time-locked activation of medial occipital, presumably visual, cortex. Most relevant, spatial tactile attention enhanced stimulus-induced gamma-band activity in brain regions consistent with contralateral S1 and deepened and prolonged the stimulus induced suppression of beta- and alpha-band activity, maximal in parieto-occipital cortex. Additionally, the beta rebound over contralateral sensorimotor areas was suppressed. We hypothesize that spatial-selective attention enhances the saliency of sensory representations by synchronizing neuronal responses in early somatosensory cortex and thereby enhancing their impact on downstream areas and facilitating interareal processing. Furthermore, processing of tactile patterns also seems to recruit visual cortex and this even more so for attended compared with unattended stimuli.}

      \field{abstract}{Perceptual decisions that are used to select particular actions can appear to be formed in an intentional framework, in which sensory evidence is converted directly into a plan to act. However, because the relationship between perceptual decision-making and action selection has been tested primarily under conditions in which the two could not be dissociated, it is not known whether this intentional framework plays a general role in forming perceptual decisions or only reflects certain task conditions. To dissociate decision and motor processing in the brain, we recorded from individual neurons in the lateral intraparietal area of monkeys performing a task that included a flexible association between a decision about the direction of random-dot motion and the direction of the appropriate eye-movement response. We targeted neurons that responded selectively in anticipation of a particular eye-movement response. We found that these neurons encoded the perceptual decision in a manner that was distinct from how they encoded the associated response. These decision-related signals were evident regardless of whether the appropriate decision-response association was indicated before, during, or after decision formation. The results suggest that perceptual decision-making and action selection are different brain processes that only appear to be inseparable under particular behavioral contexts.}

      \field{abstract}{Recent studies have provided conflicting accounts regarding where in the human brain visual short-term memory (VSTM) content is stored, with strong univariate fMRI responses being reported in superior intraparietal sulcus (IPS), but robust multivariate decoding being reported in occipital cortex. Given the continuous influx of information in everyday vision, VSTM storage under distraction is often required. We found that neither distractor presence nor predictability during the memory delay affected behavioral performance. Similarly, superior IPS exhibited consistent decoding of VSTM content across all distractor manipulations and had multivariate responses that closely tracked behavioral VSTM performance. However, occipital decoding of VSTM content was substantially modulated by distractor presence and predictability. Furthermore, we found no effect of target-distractor similarity on VSTM behavioral performance, further challenging the role of sensory regions in VSTM storage. Overall, consistent with previous univariate findings, our results indicate that superior IPS, but not occipital cortex, has a central role in VSTM storage.}

      \field{abstract}{The visual receptive field physiology and anatomical connections of the lateral intraparietal area (area LIP), a visuomotor area in the lateral bank of the inferior parietal lobule, were investigated in the cynomolgus monkey (Macaca fascicularis). Afferent input and physiological properties of area 5 neurons in the medial bank of the intraparietal sulcus (i.e., area PEa) were also determined. Area LIP is composed of two myeloarchitectonic zones: a ventral zone (LIPv), which is densely myelinated, and a lightly myelinated dorsal zone (LIPd) adjacent to visual area 7a. Previous single-unit recording studies in our laboratory have characterized visuomotor properties of area LIP neurons, including many neurons with powerful saccade-related activity. In the first part of the present study, single-unit recordings were used to map visual receptive fields from neurons in the two myeloarchitectonic zones of LIP. Receptive field size and eccentricity were compared to those in adjacent area 7a. The second part of the study investigated the cortico-cortical connections of area LIP neurons using tritiated amino acid injections and fluorescent retrograde tracers placed directly into different rostrocaudal and dorsoventral parts of area LIP. The approach to area LIP was through somatosensory area 5, which eliminated the possibility of diffusion of tracers into area 7a. Unlike many area 7a receptive fields, which are large and bilateral, area LIP receptive fields were much smaller and exclusively confined to the contralateral visual field. In area LIP, an orderly progression in visual receptive fields was evident as the recording electrode moved tangentially to the cortical surface and through the depths of area LIP. The overall visual receptive field organization, however, yielded only a rough topography with some duplications in receptive field representation within a given rostrocaudal or dorsoventral part of LIP. The central visual field representation was generally located more dorsally and the peripheral visual field more ventrally within the sulcus. The lower visual field was represented more anteriorly and the upper visual field more posteriorly. In LIP, receptive field size increased with eccentricity but with much variability with in the sample. Area LIPv was found to have reciprocal cortico-cortical connections with many extrastriate visual areas, including the parieto-occipital visual area PO; areas V3, V3A, and V4: the middle temporal area (MT); the middle superior temporal area (MST); dorsal prelunate area (DP); and area TEO (the occipital division of the intratemporal cortex). Area LIPv is also connected to area TF in the lateral posterior parahippocampal gyrus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)}

      \field{abstract}{We have previously documented the exquisite motion sensitivity of neurons in extrastriate area MT by studying the relationship between their responses and the direction and strength of visual motion signals delivered to their receptive fields. These results suggested that MT neurons might provide the signals supporting behavioral choice in visual discrimination tasks. To approach this question from another direction, we have now studied the relationship between the discharge of MT neurons and behavioral choice, independently of the effects of visual stimulation. We found that trial-to-trial variability in neuronal signals was correlated with the choices the monkey made. Therefore, when a directionally selective neuron in area MT fires more vigorously, the monkey is more likely to make a decision in favor of the preferred direction of the cell. The magnitude of the relationship was modest, on average, but was highly significant across a sample of 299 cells from four monkeys. The relationship was present for all stimuli (including those without a net motion signal), and for all but the weakest responses. The relationship was reduced or eliminated when the demands of the task were changed so that the directional signal carried by the cell was less informative. The relationship was evident within 50 ms of response onset, and persisted throughout the stimulus presentation. On average, neurons that were more sensitive to weak motion signals had a stronger relationship to behavior than those that were less sensitive. These observations are consistent with the idea that neuronal signals in MT are used by the monkey to determine the direction of stimulus motion. The modest relationship between behavioral choice and the discharge of any one neuron, and the prevalence of the relationship across the population, make it likely that signals from many neurons are pooled to form the data on which behavioral choices are based.}

      \field{abstract}{We compared the ability of psychophysical observers and single cortical neurons to discriminate weak motion signals in a stochastic visual display. All data were obtained from rhesus monkeys trained to perform a direction discrimination task near psychophysical threshold. The conditions for such a comparison were ideal in that both psychophysical and physiological data were obtained in the same animals, on the same sets of trials, and using the same visual display. In addition, the psychophysical task was tailored in each experiment to the physiological properties of the neuron under study; the visual display was matched to each neuron's preference for size, speed, and direction of motion. Under these conditions, the sensitivity of most MT neurons was very similar to the psychophysical sensitivity of the animal observers. In fact, the responses of single neurons typically provided a satisfactory account of both absolute psychophysical threshold and the shape of the psychometric function relating performance to the strength of the motion signal. Thus, psychophysical decisions in our task are likely to be based upon a relatively small number of neural signals. These signals could be carried by a small number of neurons if the responses of the pooled neurons are statistically independent. Alternatively, the signals may be carried by a much larger pool of neurons if their responses are partially intercorrelated.}

      \field{abstract}{We propose a linear ballistic accumulator (LBA) model of decision making and reaction time. The LBA is simpler than other models of choice response time, with independent accumulators that race towards a common response threshold. Activity in the accumulators increases in a linear and deterministic manner. The simplicity of the model allows complete analytic solutions for choices between any number of alternatives. These solutions (and freely-available computer code) make the model easy to apply to both binary and multiple choice situations. Using data from five previously published experiments, we demonstrate that the LBA model successfully accommodates empirical phenomena from binary and multiple choice tasks that have proven difficult for other theoretical accounts. Our results are encouraging in a field beset by the tradeoff between complexity and completeness. {©} 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}

      \field{abstract}{Patients with frontal lobe damage have difficulty suppressing reflexive saccades to salient visual stimuli, indicating that frontal lobe neocortex helps to suppress saccades as well as to produce them. In the present study, a role for the frontal eye field (FEF) in suppressing saccades was demonstrated in macaque monkeys by application of intracortical microstimulation during the performance of a visually guided saccade task, a memory prosaccade task, and a memory antisaccade task. A train of low-intensity (20-50 microA) electrical pulses was applied simultaneously with the disappearance of a central fixation target, which was always the cue to initiate a saccade. Trials with and without stimulation were compared, and significantly longer saccade latencies on stimulation trials were considered evidence of suppression. Low-intensity stimulation suppressed task-related saccades at 30 of 77 sites tested. In many cases saccades were suppressed throughout the microstimulation period (usually 450 ms) and then executed shortly after the train ended. Memory-guided saccades were most dramatically suppressed and were often rendered hypometric, whereas visually guided saccades were less severely suppressed by stimulation. At 18 FEF sites, the suppression of saccades was the only observable effect of electrical stimulation. Contraversive saccades were usually more strongly suppressed than ipsiversive ones, and cells recorded at such purely suppressive sites commonly had either foveal receptive fields or postsaccadic responses. At 12 other FEF sites at which saccadic eye movements were elicited at low thresholds, task-related saccades whose vectors differed from that of the electrically elicited saccade were suppressed by electrical stimulation. Such suppression at saccade sites was observed even with currents below the threshold for eliciting saccades. Pure suppression sites tended to be located near or in the fundus, deeper in the anterior bank of the arcuate than elicited saccade sites. Stimulation in the prefrontal association cortex anterior to FEF did not suppress saccades, nor did stimulation in premotor cortex posterior to FEF. These findings indicate that the primate FEF can help orchestrate saccadic eye movements by suppressing inappropriate saccade vectors as well as by selecting, specifying, and triggering appropriate saccades. We hypothesize that saccades could be suppressed both through local FEF interactions and through FEF projections to subcortical regions involved in maintaining fixation.}

      \field{abstract}{Gamma rhythms are commonly observed in many brain regions during both waking and sleep states, yet their functions and mechanisms remain a matter of debate. Here we review the cellular and synaptic mechanisms underlying gamma oscillations and outline empirical questions and controversial conceptual issues. Our main points are as follows: First, gamma-band rhythmogenesis is inextricably tied to perisomatic inhibition. Second, gamma oscillations are short-lived and typically emerge from the coordinated interaction of excitation and inhibition, which can be detected as local field potentials. Third, gamma rhythm typically concurs with irregular firing of single neurons, and the network frequency of gamma oscillations varies extensively depending on the underlying mechanism. To document gamma oscillations, efforts should be made to distinguish them from mere increases of gamma-band power and/or increased spiking activity. Fourth, the magnitude of gamma oscillation is modulated by slower rhythms. Such cross-frequency coupling may serve to couple active patches of cortical circuits. Because of their ubiquitous nature and strong correlation with the "operational modes" of local circuits, gamma oscillations continue to provide important clues about neuronal population dynamics in health and disease. Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Neuroscience Volume 35 is June 17, 2012. Please see http://www.annualreviews.org/catalog/pubdates.aspx for revised estimates.}

      \field{abstract}{Analysis of the 500 most recent scalp recordings made in the electroencephalographic laboratory at the Rochester (Minnesota) State Hospital has revealed the presence of a rolandic wicket ("en arceau") rhythm in 18 persons. Passive movements and reflex movements provoked blocking of the wicket rhythm. The interval between the beginning of the movement and the blocking was approximately the same for both types of movement. In comparison with the effect of passive movement, the blocking provoked by reflex movement was shorter and predominated more markedly on the contralateral hemisphere. Blocking of the wicket rhythm was noted also in relation to spontaneous voluntary movements. When these were unilateral the blocking effect involved both central areas, usually the contralateral before the homolateral. The beginning of the contralateral blocking usually preceded the onset of the muscular contraction. Blocking was observed also with movements on command. At first it had the characteristics of a generalized arousal; in succeeding tests it became limited to the wicket rhythm of the rolandic areas. The wicket blocking followed with a fairly constant short delay after the beginning of the spoken order and, depending on the duration of the order, was seen approximately simultaneously with or a varied time before the onset of the muscular contraction. Tactile stimuli also produced bilateral blocking of wicket rhythm, with the stronger effect on the contralateral side. Visual and mental activity were able to provoke some degree of wicket together with alpha blocking in accord with the level of attention required. The mechanisms through which the above stimuli provoke the blocking of the wicket rhythm are discussed. {©} 1959.}

      \field{abstract}{Items held in working memory can be either attended or not, depending on their current behavioral relevance. It has been suggested that unattended contents might be solely retained in an activity-silent form. Instead, we demonstrate here that encoding unattended contents involves a division of labor. While visual cortex only maintains attended items, intraparietal areas and the frontal eye fields represent both attended and unattended items.}

      \field{abstract}{Studies in humans and non-human primates have provided evidence for storage of working memory contents in multiple regions ranging from sensory to parietal and prefrontal cortex. We discuss potential explanations for these distributed representations: (i) features in sensory regions versus prefrontal cortex differ in the level of abstractness and generalizability; and (ii) features in prefrontal cortex reflect representations that are transformed for guidance of upcoming behavioral actions. We propose that the propensity to produce persistent activity is a general feature of cortical networks. Future studies may have to shift focus from asking where working memory can be observed in the brain to how a range of specialized brain areas together transform sensory information into a delayed behavioral response.}

      \field{abstract}{Howcontent is stored in thehumanbrain during visual short-termmemory(VSTM)is stillanopenquestion. Different theories postulate storage of remembered stimuli in prefrontal, parietal, or visual areas. Aiming at a distinction between these theories, we investigated the content-specificity of BOLD signals from various brain regions during a VSTM task using multivariate pattern classification. To partic- ipate in memory maintenance, candidate regions would need to have information about the different contents held in memory. We identified two brain regions where local patterns of fMRI signals represented the remembered content. Apart from the previously established storage in visual areas,wealso discovered an area in the posterior parietal cortex where activity patterns allowed us to decode the specific stimuli held in memory. Our results demonstrate that storage in VSTM extends beyond visual areas, but no frontal regions were found. Thus, while frontal and parietal areas typically coactivate during VSTM, maintenance of content in the frontoparietal network might be limited to parietal cortex.}

      \field{abstract}{Recent advances in brain connectivity methods have made it possible to identify hubs-the brain's most globally connected regions. Such regions are essential for coordinating brain functions due to their connectivity with numerous regions with a variety of specializations. Current structural and functional connectivity methods generally agree that default mode network (DMN) regions have among the highest global brain connectivity (GBC). We developed two novel statistical approaches using resting state functional connectivity MRI-weighted and unweighted GBC (wGBC and uGBC)-to test the hypothesis that the highest global connectivity also occurs in the cognitive control network (CCN), a network anti-correlated with the DMN across a variety of tasks. High global connectivity was found in both CCN and DMN. The newly developed wGBC approach improves upon existing methods by quantifying inter-subject consistency, quantifying the highest GBC values by percentage, and avoiding arbitrarily connection strength thresholding. The uGBC approach is based on graph theory and includes many of these improvements, but still requires an arbitrary connection threshold. We found high GBC in several subcortical regions (e.g., hippocampus, basal ganglia) only with wGBC despite the regions' extensive anatomical connectivity. These results demonstrate the complementary utility of wGBC and uGBC analyses for the characterization of the most highly connected, and thus most functionally important, regions of the brain. Additionally, the high connectivity of both the CCN and the DMN demonstrates that brain regions outside primary sensory-motor networks are highly involved in coordinating information throughout the brain. {©} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

      \field{abstract}{Extensive evidence suggests that the human ability to adaptively implement a wide variety of tasks is preferentially a result of the operation of a fronto-parietal brain network (FPN). We hypothesized that this network's adaptability is made possible by flexible hubs: brain regions that rapidly update their pattern of global functional connectivity according to task demands. Using recent advances in characterizing brain network organization and dynamics, we identified mechanisms consistent with the flexible hub theory. We found that the FPN's brain-wide functional connectivity pattern shifted more than those of other networks across a variety of task states and that these connectivity patterns could be used to identify the current task. Furthermore, these patterns were consistent across practiced and novel tasks, suggesting that reuse of flexible hub connectivity patterns facilitates adaptive (novel) task performance. Together, these findings support a central role for fronto-parietal flexible hubs in cognitive control and adaptive implementation of task demands}

      \field{abstract}{Consensus across hundreds of published studies indicates that the same cortical regions are involved in many forms of cognitive control. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we found that these coactive regions form a functionally connected cognitive control network (CCN). Network status was identified by convergent methods, including: high inter-regional correlations during rest and task performance, consistently higher correlations within the CCN than the rest of cortex, co-activation in a visual search task, and mutual sensitivity to decision difficulty. Regions within the CCN include anterior cingulate cortex/pre-supplementary motor area (ACC/pSMA), dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), inferior frontal junction (IFJ), anterior insular cortex (AIC), dorsal pre-motor cortex (dPMC), and posterior parietal cortex (PPC). We used a novel visual line search task which included periods when the probe stimuli were occluded but subjects had to maintain and update working memory in preparation for the sudden appearance of a probe stimulus. The six CCN regions operated as a tightly coupled network during the 'non-occluded' portions of this task, with all regions responding to probe events. In contrast, the network was differentiated during occluded search. DLPFC, not ACC/pSMA, was involved in target memory maintenance when probes were absent, while both regions became active in preparation for difficult probes at the end of each occluded period. This approach illustrates one way in which a neuronal network can be identified, its high functional connectivity established, and its components dissociated in order to better understand the interactive and specialized internal mechanisms of that network. {©} 2007 Elsevier Inc.

      \field{abstract}{Single-neuron recordings from behaving primates have established a link between working memory processes and information-specific neuronal persistent activity in the prefrontal cortex. Using a network model endowed with a columnar architecture and based on the physiological properties of cortical neurons and synapses, we have examined the synaptic mechanisms of selective persistent activity underlying spatial working memory in the prefrontal cortex. Our model reproduces the phenomenology of the oculomotor delayed-response experiment of Funahashi et al. (S. Funahashi, C.J. Bruce and P.S. Goldman-Rakic, Mnemonic coding of visual space in the monkey's dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. J Neurophysiol 61:331-349, 1989). To observe stable spontaneous and persistent activity, we find that recurrent synaptic excitation should be primarily mediated by NMDA receptors, and that overall recurrent synaptic interactions should be dominated by inhibition. Isodirectional tuning of adjacent pyramidal cells and interneurons can be accounted for by a structured pyramid-to-interneuron connectivity. Robust memory storage against random drift of the tuned persistent activity and against distractors (intervening stimuli during the delay period) may be enhanced by neuromodulation of recurrent synapses. Experimentally testable predictions concerning the neural basis of working memory are discussed.}

      \field{abstract}{Neural correlates of visual categories have been previously identified in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). However, whether individual neurons can represent multiple categories is unknown. Varying degrees of generalization versus specialization of neurons in the PFC have been theorized. We recorded from lateral PFC neural activity while monkeys switched between two different and independent categorical distinctions (Cats versus Dogs, Sports Cars versus Sedans). We found that many PFC neurons reflected both categorical distinctions. In fact, these multitasking neurons had the strongest category effects. This stands in contrast to our lab's recent report that monkeys switching between competing categorical distinctions (applied to the same stimulus set) showed independent representations. We suggest that cognitive demands determine whether PFC neurons function as category " multitaskers." {©} 2010 Elsevier Inc.}

      \field{abstract}{Whenperceptual decisions are coupled to a specific effector, preparatorymotorcortical activitymayprovide awindowinto the dynamics of the perceptual choice. Specifically, previous studies have observed a buildup of choice-selective activity in motor regions over time reflecting the integrated sensory evidence provided by visual cortex. Here we ask how this choice-selective motor activity is modified by prior expectation during a visual motion discrimination task. Computational models of decision making formalize decisions as the accumulation of evidence from a starting point to a decision bound. Within this framework, expectation could change the starting point, rate of accumulation, or the decision bound. Using magneto-encephalography in human observers, we specifically tested for changes in the starting point in choice-selective oscillatory activity over motor cortex. Inducing prior expectation about motion direction biased subjects' perceptual judgments as well as the choice-selective motor activity in the 8–30 Hz frequency range before stimulus onset; the individual strength of these behavioral and neural biases were correlated across subjects. In the absence of explicit expectation cues, spontaneous biases in choice-selective activity were evident overmotorcortex. These also predicted eventual perceptual choiceandwere, at least in part, induced by the choice on the previous trial. We conclude that both endogenous and explicitly induced perceptual expectations bias the starting point of decision-related activity, before the accumulation of sensory evidence.}

      \field{abstract}{The resistive or non-resistive nature of the extracellular space in the brain is still debated, and is an important issue for correctly modeling extracellular potentials. Here, we first show theoretically that if the medium is resistive, the frequency scaling should be the same for electroencephalogram (EEG) and magnetoencephalogram (MEG) signals at low frequencies ({<}10 Hz). To test this prediction, we analyzed the spectrum of simultaneous EEG and MEG measurements in four human subjects. The frequency scaling of EEG displays coherent variations across the brain, in general between 1/f and 1/f{\^{}}2, and tends to be smaller in parietal/temporal regions. In a given region, although the variability of the frequency scaling exponent was higher for MEG compared to EEG, both signals consistently scale with a different exponent. In some cases, the scaling was similar, but only when the signal-to-noise ratio of the MEG was low. Several methods of noise correction for environmental and instrumental noise were tested, and they all increased the difference between EEG and MEG scaling. In conclusion, there is a significant difference in frequency scaling between EEG and MEG, which can be explained if the extracellular medium (including other layers such as dura matter and skull) is globally non-resistive.}

      \field{abstract}{BACKGROUND: It has been acknowledged that the frequency spectrum of measured electromagnetic (EM) brain signals shows a decrease in power with increasing frequency. This spectral behaviour may lead to difficulty in distinguishing event-related peaks from ongoing brain activity in the electro- and magnetoencephalographic (EEG and MEG) signal spectra. This can become an issue especially in the analysis of low frequency oscillations (LFOs) - below 0.5 Hz - which are currently being observed in signal recordings linked with specific pathologies such as epileptic seizures or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), in sleep studies, etc.{\$}\backslash{\$}n{\$}\backslash{\$}nMETHODS: In this work we propose a simple method that can be used to compensate for this 1/f trend hence achieving spectral normalisation. This method involves filtering the raw measured EM signal through a differentiator prior to further data analysis.{\$}\backslash{\$}n{\$}\backslash{\$}nRESULTS: Applying the proposed method to various exemplary datasets including very low frequency EEG recordings, epileptic seizure recordings, MEG data and Evoked Response data showed that this compensating procedure provides a flat spectral base onto which event related peaks can be clearly observed.{\$}\backslash{\$}n{\$}\backslash{\$}nCONCLUSION: Findings suggest that the proposed filter is a useful tool for the analysis of physiological data especially in revealing very low frequency peaks which may otherwise be obscured by the 1/f spectral activity inherent in EEG/MEG recordings.}

      \field{abstract}{Besides his more famous works of philosophy--"Discourse on Method, Meditations on First Philosophy, and "Principles of Philosophy--Descartes devoted a great deal of time and thought to the study of physiology and anatomy. An account of his activities in 1629 reports that he visited butcher shops on an almost daily basis to study specific animal organs. In the 1630s, he assisted in the dissection of human cadavers--all to satisfy his intense curiosity about how bodies, animal and human, work. The fruits of this research can be found in his "Treatise of Man, a work that he decided not to publish for fear of suffering the same fate as Galileo. Consequently, this fascinating treatise did not appear until twelve years after his death. Among its many intriguing features are his detailed descriptions of the nervous system and its interactions with the muscles to create movement in response to stimulus. Though we now know that many of these details are wrong, Descartes' understanding that much of the body functions as a mechanism was a stroke of genius. He is the first to describe the reflex arc, anticipating Pavlov and the behaviorists by almost 300 years. The idea of the body as a kind of animal machine that functions according to physical laws was an immense advance over the previous scholastic notions based on Aristotle, which merely begged the question of how the various organs of the body work by stating that it is in their nature to perform their specific functions. This is a landmark work that students of history, medicine, biology, and the history of science will find richly rewarding.}

      \field{abstract}{Perceptual decision making is a complex process that requires multiple computations, including the accumulation of sensory evidence and an ongoing evaluation of the accumulation process to use for prediction and adjustment. Implementing these computations likely involves interactions among many brain regions. For perceptual decisions linked to oculomotor actions, neural correlates of sensory evidence accumulation have been identified in several cortical areas, including the frontal eye field and lateral intraparietal area, and one of their direct, subcortical targets, the superior colliculus. These structures are also connected indirectly, via the basal ganglia. The basal ganglia pathway has been theorized to contribute to perceptual decision making, but the nature of this contribution has yet to be examined directly. Here we show that in monkeys performing a reaction-time visual motion direction-discrimination task, neurons in a primary input structure of the basal ganglia, the caudate nucleus, encode three aspects of decision making: evidence accumulation, evaluation, and choice biases. These results indicate that the basal ganglia pathway can provide important signals to influence and assess perceptual decisions that guide oculomotor behavior.}

      \field{abstract}{Perceptual decision making requires a complex set of computations to implement, evaluate, and adjust the conversion of sensory input into a categorical judgment. Little is known about how the specific underlying computations are distributed across and within different brain regions. Using a reaction-time (RT) motion direction-discrimination task, we show that a unique combination of decision-related signals is represented in monkey frontal eye field (FEF). Some responses were modulated by choice, motion strength, and RT, consistent with a temporal accumulation of sensory evidence. These responses converged to a threshold level prior to behavioral responses, reflecting decision commitment. Other responses continued to be modulated by motion strength even after decision commitment, possibly providing a memory trace to help evaluate and adjust the decision process with respect to rewarding outcomes. Both response types were encoded by FEF neurons with both narrow- and broad-spike waveforms, presumably corresponding to inhibitory interneurons and excitatory pyramidal neurons, respectively, and with diverse visual, visuomotor, and motor properties, albeit with different frequencies. Thus, neurons throughout FEF appear to make multiple contributions to decision making that only partially overlap with contributions from other brain regions. These results help to constrain how networks of brain regions interact to generate perceptual decisions.}

      \field{abstract}{Direction-selective neurons in the middle temporal visual area (MT) are crucially involved in motion perception, although it is not known exactly how the activity of these neurons is interpreted by the rest of the brain. Here we report that in a two-alternative task, the activity of MT neurons is interpreted as evidence for one direction and against the other. We measured the speed and accuracy of decisions as rhesus monkeys performed a direction-discrimination task. On half of the trials, we stimulated direction-selective neurons in area MT, thereby causing the monkeys to choose the neurons' preferred direction more often. Microstimulation quickened decisions in favor of the preferred direction and slowed decisions in favor of the opposite direction. Even on trials in which microstimulation did not induce a preferred direction choice, it still affected response times. Our findings suggest that during the formation of a decision, sensory evidence for competing propositions is compared and accumulates to a decision-making threshold.}

      \field{abstract}{An attempt was made to determine the effects of attention on average evoked potentials when no general change in the alertness of the subject and when no peripheral gating of sensory inputs can be assumed to operate. Human subjects viewed a 50 msec flash of light superimposed on a fluctuating background (e.g., a circle alternating aperiodically with a square). In one of the two experimental conditions, the subject was instructed to ignore the background alternations and to respond to the flash; in the other condition, the subject was required to ignore the flash and to respond to the fluctuations in the background. It was found that the stimulus to which the subject had to respond elicited an AEP with a considerably enhanced late positive component (latency to peak 250-300 msec). {©} 1967.}

      \field{abstract}{Motion-induced blindness {\{}(MIB){\}} is a visual phenomenon in which a salient static target spontaneously fluctuates in and out of visual awareness when surrounded by a moving mask pattern. It has been hypothesized that {\{}MIB{\}} reflects an antagonistic interplay between cortical representations of the static target and moving mask. Here, we report evidence for such antagonism between human ventral and dorsal visual cortex during {\{}MIB.{\}} Functional magnetic resonance imaging {\{}(fMRI){\}} responses in ventral visual area V4 decreased with the subjective disappearance of the target. These response decreases were specific for the cortical subregion corresponding retinotopically to the target, occurred early in time with respect to the perceptual report, and could not be explained by shifts of attention in reaction to target disappearance. At the same time, responses increased in mask-specific subregions in dorsal visual areas in and around the intraparietal sulcus. These opposite responses in ventral and dorsal visual areas occurred only during subjective target disappearance, not when the target was physically removed. Perceptual reports of target disappearance were furthermore associated with a {\{}"{\}}global{\{}"{\}} modulation of activity, which was delayed in time, and evident throughout early visual cortex, for both subjective target disappearance and physical target removal. We conclude that awareness of the target is tightly linked to the strength of its representation in ventral visual cortex, and that the mask representation in dorsal visual cortex plays a crucial role in the spontaneous suppression of the target representation during {\{}MIB.{\}}}

      \field{abstract}{Simple perceptual decisions are ideally suited for studying the sensorimotor transformations underlying flexible behavior [1, 2]. During perceptual detection, a noisy sensory signal is converted into a behavioral report of the presence or absence of a perceptual experience [3]. Here, we used magnetoencephalography (MEG) to link the dynamics of neural population activity in human motor cortex to perceptual choices in a "yes/no" visual motion detection task. We found that (1) motor response-selective MEG activity in the "gamma" (64-100 Hz) and "beta" (12-36 Hz) frequency ranges predicted subjects' choices several seconds before their overt manual response; (2) this choice-predictive activity built up gradually during stimulus viewing toward both "yes" and "no" choices; and (3) the choice-predictive activity in motor cortex reflected the temporal integral of gamma-band activity in motion-sensitive area MT during stimulus viewing. Because gamma-band activity in MT reflects visual motion strength [4], these findings suggest that, during motion detection, motor plans for both "yes" and "no" choices result from continuously accumulating sensory evidence. We conclude that frequency-specific neural population activity at the cortical output stage of sensorimotor pathways provides a window into the mechanisms underlying perceptual decisions. {©} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

      \field{abstract}{A person's ability to detect a weak visual target stimulus varies from one viewing to the next. We tested whether the trial-to-trial fluctuations of neural population activity in the human brain are related to the fluctuations of behavioral performance in a "yes-no" visual motion-detection task. We recorded neural population activity with whole head magnetoencephalography (MEG) while subjects searched for a weak coherent motion signal embedded in spatiotemporal noise. We found that, during motion viewing, MEG activity in the 12- to 24-Hz ("beta") frequency range is higher, on average, before correct behavioral choices than before errors and that it predicts correct choices on a trial-by-trial basis. This performance-predictive activity is not evident in the prestimulus baseline and builds up slowly after stimulus onset. Source reconstruction revealed that the performance-predictive activity is expressed in the posterior parietal and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices and, less strongly, in the visual motion-sensitive area MT+. The 12- to 24-Hz activity in these key stages of the human dorsal visual pathway is correlated with behavioral choice in both target-present and target-absent conditions. Importantly, in the absence of the target, 12- to 24-Hz activity tends to be higher before "no" choices ("correct rejects") than before "yes" choices ("false alarms"). It thus predicts the accuracy, and not the content, of subjects' upcoming perceptual reports. We conclude that beta band activity in the human dorsal visual pathway indexes, and potentially controls, the efficiency of neural computations underlying simple perceptual decisions.}

      \field{abstract}{A common or multiple-demand (MD) pattern of frontal and parietal activity is associated with diverse cognitive demands, and with standard tests of fluid intelligence. In intelligent behaviour, goals are achieved by assembling a series of sub-tasks, creating structured mental programs. Single cell and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data indicate a key role for MD cortex in defining and controlling the parts of such programs, with focus on the specific content of a current cognitive operation, rapid reorganization as mental focus is changed, and robust separation of successive task steps. Resembling the structured problem-solving of symbolic artificial intelligence, the mental programs of MD cortex appear central to intelligent thought and action. {©} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

      \field{abstract}{In cortical networks, synaptic excitation is mediated by AMPA- and NMDA-type receptors. NMDA differ from AMPA synaptic potentials with regard to peak current, time course, and a strong voltage-dependent nonlinearity. Here we illustrate based on empirical and computational findings that these specific biophysical properties may have profound implications for the dynamics of cortical networks, and via dynamics on cognitive functions like active memory. The discussion will be led along a minimal set of neural equations introduced to capture the essential dynamics of the various phenomena described. NMDA currents could establish cortical bistability and may provide the relatively constant synaptic drive needed to robustly maintain enhanced levels of activity during working memory epochs, freeing fast AMPA currents for other computational purposes. Perhaps more importantly, variations in NMDA synaptic input-due to their biophysical particularities-control the dynamical regime within which single neurons and networks reside. By provoking bursting, chaotic irregularity, and coherent oscillations their major effect may be on the temporal pattern of spiking activity, rather than on average firing rate. During active memory, neurons may thus be pushed into a spiking regime that harbors complex temporal structure, potentially optimal for the encoding and processing of temporal sequence information. These observations provide a qualitatively different view on the role of synaptic excitation in neocortical dynamics than entailed by many more abstract models. In this sense, this article is a plead for taking the specific biophysics of real neurons and synapses seriously when trying to account for the neurobiology of cognition. {©} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

      \field{abstract}{Working memory has often been modeled and conceptualized as a kind of binary (bistable) memory switch, where stimuli turn on plateau-like persistent activity in subsets of cells, in line with many in vivo electrophysiological reports. A potentially related form of bistability, termed up- and down-states, has been studied with regard to its synaptic and ionic basis in vivo and in reduced cortical preparations. Also single cell mechanisms for producing bistability have been proposed and investigated in brain slices and computationally. Recently, however, it has been emphasized that clear plateau-like bistable activity is rather rare during working memory tasks, and that neurons exhibit a multitude of different temporally unfolding activity profiles and temporal structure within their spiking dynamics. Hence, working memory seems to be a highly dynamical neural process with yet unknown mappings from dynamical to computational properties. Empirical findings on ramping activity profiles and temporal structure will be reviewed, as well as neural models that attempt to account for it and its computational significance. Furthermore, recent in vivo, neural culture, and in vitro preparations will be discussed that offer new possibilities for studying the biophysical mechanisms underlying computational processes during working memory. These preparations have revealed additional evidence for temporal structure and spatio-temporally organized attractor states in cortical networks, as well as for specific computational properties that may characterize synaptic processing during high-activity states as during working memory. Together such findings may lay the foundations for highly dynamical theories of working memory based on biophysical principles. {©} 2005 IBRO.}

      \field{abstract}{BACKGROUND Neuropsychology and human functional neuroimaging have implicated human parietal cortex in numerical processing, and macaque electrophysiology has shown that intraparietal areas house neurons tuned to numerosity. Yet although the areas responding overall during numerical tasks have been well defined by neuroimaging, a direct demonstration of individual number coding by spatial patterns has thus far been elusive. RESULTS We used multivariate pattern recognition on high-resolution functional imaging data to decode the information content of fine-scale signals evoked by different individual numbers. Parietal activation patterns for individual numerosities could be accurately discriminated and generalized across changes in low-level stimulus parameters. Distinct patterns were evoked by symbolic and nonsymbolic number formats, and individual digits were less accurately decoded (albeit still with significant accuracy) than numbers of dots. Interestingly, the numerosity of dot sets could be predicted above chance from the brain activation patterns evoked by digits, but not vice versa. Finally, number-evoked patterns changed in a gradual fashion as a function of numerical distance for the nonsymbolic notation, compatible with some degree of orderly layout of individual number representations. CONCLUSIONS Our findings demonstrate partial format invariance of individual number codes that is compatible with more numerous but more broadly tuned populations for nonsymbolic than for symbolic numbers, as postulated by recent computational models. In more general terms, our results illustrate the potential of functional magnetic resonance imaging pattern recognition to understand the detailed format of representations within a single semantic category, and beyond sensory cortical areas for which columnar architectures are well established.}

      \field{abstract}{The lateralized readiness potential (LRP) is an electrophysiological indicator of the central acti- vation of motor responses. Procedures for deriving the LRPon the basis of event-related brain po- tential (ERP) waveforms obtained over the left and right motor cortices are described, and some findings are summarized that show that the LRPis likely to reflect activation processes within the motor cortex. Two experiments investigating spatial S-R compatibility effects are reported that demonstrate that, because of systematic overlaps of motor and nonmotor asymmetries, LRPwave- forms derived by the double subtraction method cannot alwaysbe interpreted unequivocallyin terms of response activation. Such confounds can be detected when LRPwaveforms are compared with dif- ference waveforms obtained by the double subtraction method from ERPs elicited at other lateral scalp sites.}

      \field{abstract}{Traditionally, load sensitivity of sustained, elevated activity has been taken as an index of storage for a limited number of items in visual short-term memory (VSTM). Recently, studies have demonstrated that the contents of a single item held in VSTM can be decoded from early visual cortex, despite the fact that these areas do not exhibit elevated, sustained activity. It is unknown, however, whether the patterns of neural activity decoded from sensory cortex change as a function of load, as one would expect from a region storing multiple representations. Here, we use multivoxel pattern analysis to examine the neural representations of VSTM in humans across multiple memory loads. In an important extension of previous findings, our results demonstrate that the contents of VSTM can be decoded from areas that exhibit a transient response to visual stimuli, but not from regions that exhibit elevated, sustained load-sensitive delay-period activity. Moreover, the neural information present in these transiently activated areas decreases significantly with increasing load, indicating load sensitivity of the patterns of activity that support VSTM maintenance. Importantly, the decrease in classification performance as a function of load is correlated with within-subject changes in mnemonic resolution. These findings indicate that distributed patterns of neural activity in putatively sensory visual cortex support the representation and precision of information in VSTM.}

      \field{abstract}{In this review, we consider the potential functional role of beta-band oscillations, which at present is not yet well understood. We discuss evidence from recent studies on top-down mechanisms involved in cognitive processing, on the motor system and on the pathophysiology of movement disorders that suggest a unifying hypothesis: beta-band activity seems related to the maintenance of the current sensorimotor or cognitive state. We hypothesize that beta oscillations and/or coupling in the beta-band are expressed more strongly if the maintenance of the status quo is intended or predicted, than if a change is expected. Moreover, we suggest that pathological enhancement of beta-band activity is likely to result in an abnormal persistence of the status quo and a deterioration of flexible behavioural and cognitive control. {©} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.}

      \field{abstract}{Classical theories of sensory processing view the brain as a passive, stimulus-driven device. By contrast, more recent approaches emphasize the constructive nature of perception, viewing it as an active and highly selective process. Indeed, there is ample evidence that the processing of stimuli is controlled by top-down influences that strongly shape the intrinsic dynamics of thalamocortical networks and constantly create predictions about forthcoming sensory events. We discuss recent experiments indicating that such predictions might be embodied in the temporal structure of both stimulus-evoked and ongoing activity, and that synchronous oscillations are particularly important in this process. Coherence among subthreshold membrane potential fluctuations could be exploited to express selective functional relationships during states of expectancy or attention, and these dynamic patterns could allow the grouping and selection of distributed neuronal responses for further processing.}

      \field{abstract}{Medial temporal brain regions such as the hippocampal formation and parahippocampal cortex have been generally implicated in navigation and visual memory. However, the specific function of each of these regions is not yet clear. Here we present evidence that a particular area within human parahippocampal cortex is involved in a critical component of navigation: perceiving the local visual environment. This region, which we name the 'parahippocampal place area' (PPA), responds selectively and automatically in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to passively viewed scenes, but only weakly to single objects and not at all to faces. The critical factor for this activation appears to be the presence in the stimulus of information about the layout of local space. The response in the PPA to scenes with spatial layout but no discrete objects (empty rooms) is as strong as the response to complex meaningful scenes containing multiple objects (the same rooms furnished) and over twice as strong as the response to arrays of multiple objects without three-dimensional spatial context (the furniture from these rooms on a blank background). This response is reduced if the surfaces in the scene are rearranged so that they no longer define a coherent space. We propose that the PPA represents places by encoding the geometry of the local environment.}

      \field{abstract}{A crucial role for working memory in temporary information processing and guidance of complex behavior has been recognized for many decades. There is emerging consensus that working-memory maintenance results from the interactions among long-term memory representations and basic processes, including attention, that are instantiated as reentrant loops between frontal and posterior cortical areas, as well as sub-cortical structures. The nature of such interactions can account for capacity limitations, lifespan changes, and restricted transfer after working-memory training. Recent data and models indicate that working memory may also be based on synaptic plasticity and that working memory can operate on non-consciously perceived information.}

      \field{abstract}{In recent years, many new cortical areas have been identified in the macaque monkey. The number of identified connections between areas has increased even more dramatically. We report here on (1) a summary of the layout of cortical areas associated with vision and with other modalities, (2) a computerized database for storing and representing large amounts of information on connectivity patterns, and (3) the application of these data to the analysis of hierarchical organization of the cerebral cortex. Our analysis concentrates on the visual system, which includes 25 neocortical areas that are predominantly or exclusively visual in function, plus an additional 7 areas that we regard as visual-association areas on the basis of their extensive visual inputs. A total of 305 connections among these 32 visual and visual-association areas have been reported. This represents 31{\%} of the possible number of pathways if each area were connected with all others. The actual degree of connectivity is likely to be closer to 40{\%}. The great majority of pathways involve reciprocal connections between areas. There are also extensive connections with cortical areas outside the visual system proper, including the somatosensory cortex, as well as neocortical, transitional, and archicortical regions in the temporal and frontal lobes. In the somatosensory/motor system, there are 62 identified pathways linking 13 cortical areas, suggesting an overall connectivity of about 40{\%}. Based on the laminar patterns of connections between areas, we propose a hierarchy of visual areas and of somatosensory/motor areas that is more comprehensive than those suggested in other recent studies. The current version of the visual hierarchy includes 10 levels of cortical processing. Altogether, it contains 14 levels if one includes the retina and lateral geniculate nucleus at the bottom as well as the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus at the top. Within this hierarchy, there are multiple, intertwined processing streams, which, at a low level, are related to the compartmental organization of areas V1 and V2 and, at a high level, are related to the distinction between processing centers in the temporal and parietal lobes. However, there are some pathways and relationships (about 10{\%} of the total) whose descriptions do not fit cleanly into this hierarchical scheme for one reason or another. In most instances, though, it is unclear whether these represent genuine exceptions to a strict hierarchy rather than inaccuracies or uncertainities in the reported assignment}

      \field{abstract}{A dominant theory of working memory (WM), referred to as the persistent activity hypothesis, holds that recurrently connected neural networks, presumably located in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), encode and maintain WM memory items through sustained elevated activity. Re-examination of experimental data has shown that PFC activity in single units during delay periods is much more variable than predicted by such a theory and associated computational models. Alternative models of WM maintenance based on synaptic plasticity, such as short-term non-associative (non-Hebbian) synaptic facilitation have been suggested, but cannot account for encoding of novel associations. Here we test the hypothesis that a recently identified fast-expressing form of Hebbian synaptic plasticity (associative short-term potentiation, STP) is a possible mechanism for WM encoding and maintenance. Our simulations using a spiking neural network model of cortex reproduce a range of cognitive memory effects in the classical multi-item WM task of encoding and immediate free recall of word-lists. Memory reactivation in the model occurs in discrete oscillatory bursts rather than as sustained activity. We relate dynamic network activity as well as key synaptic characteristics to electrophysiological measurements. Our findings support the hypothesis that fast Hebbian STP is a key WM mechanism.}

      \field{abstract}{The extent to which different cognitive processes are “embodied” is widely debated. Previous studies have implicated sensorimotor regions such as lateral intraparietal (LIP) area in perceptual decision making. This has led to the view that perceptual decisions are embodiedin thesamesensorimotor networks that guidebodymovements.Weuse event-relatedfMRIandeffective connectivity analysis to investigate whether the human sensorimotor system implements perceptual decisions. We show that when eye and hand motor preparation is disentangled from perceptual decisions, sensorimotor areas are not involved in accumulating sensory evidence toward a perceptual decision. Instead, inferior frontal cortex increases its effective connectivity with sensory regions representing the evidence, is modulated by the amount of evidence, and shows greater task-positive BOLD responses during the perceptual decision stage. Once eye movement planning can begin, however, an intraparietal sulcus (IPS) area, putative LIP, participates in motor decisions. Moreover, sensory evidence levels modulate decision and motor preparation stages differently in different IPS regions, suggesting functional heterogeneity of the IPS. This suggests that different systems implement perceptual versus motor decisions, using different neural signatures.}

      \field{abstract}{I propose that synchronization affects communication between neuronal groups. Gamma-band (30-90 Hz) synchronization modulates excitation rapidly enough that it escapes the following inhibition and activates postsynaptic neurons effectively. Synchronization also ensures that a presynaptic activation pattern arrives at postsynaptic neurons in a temporally coordinated manner. At a postsynaptic neuron, multiple presynaptic groups converge, e.g., representing different stimuli. If a stimulus is selected by attention, its neuronal representation shows stronger and higher-frequency gamma-band synchronization. Thereby, the attended stimulus representation selectively entrains postsynaptic neurons. The entrainment creates sequences of short excitation and longer inhibition that are coordinated between pre- and postsynaptic groups to transmit the attended representation and shut out competing inputs. The predominantly bottom-up-directed gamma-band influences are controlled by predominantly top-down-directed alpha-beta-band (8-20 Hz) influences. Attention itself samples stimuli at a 7-8 Hz theta rhythm. Thus, several rhythms and their interplay render neuronal communication effective, precise, and selective.}

      \field{abstract}{Working memory allows information from transient events to persist as active neural representations [1] that can be used for goal-directed behaviors such as decision making and learning [2, 3]. Computational modeling based on neuronal firing patterns in animals suggests that one putative mechanism enabling working memory is periodic reactivation (henceforth termed "replay") of the maintained information coordinated by neural oscillations at theta (4-8 Hz) and gamma (30-80 Hz) frequency [4-6]. To investigate this possibility, we trained multivariate pattern classifier decoding algorithms on oscillatory brain responses to images depicting natural scenes, recorded with high temporal resolution via magnetoencephalography. These classifiers were applied to brain activity recorded during the subsequent five second maintenance of the scenes. This decoding revealed replay during the entire maintenance interval. Replay was specific to whether an indoor or an outdoor scene was maintained and whether maintenance centered on configural associations of scene elements or just single scene elements. Replay was coordinated by the phase of theta and the amount of theta coordination was correlated with working memory performance. By confirming the predictions of a mechanistic model and linking these to behavioral performance in humans, these findings identify theta-coupled replay as a mechanism of working memory maintenance. {©} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

      \field{abstract}{Although short-term plasticity is believed to play a fundamental role in cortical computation, empirical evidence bearing on its role during behavior is scarce. Here we looked for the signature of short-term plasticity in the fine-timescale spiking relationships of a simultaneously recorded population of physiologically identified pyramidal cells and interneurons, in the medial prefrontal cortex of the rat, in a working memory task. On broader timescales, sequentially organized and transiently active neurons reliably differentiated between different trajectories of the rat in the maze. On finer timescales, putative monosynaptic interactions reflected short-term plasticity in their dynamic and predictable modulation across various aspects of the task, beyond a statistical accounting for the effect of the neurons' co-varying firing rates. Seeking potential mechanisms for such effects, we found evidence for both firing pattern-dependent facilitation and depression, as well as for a supralinear effect of presynaptic coincidence on the firing of postsynaptic targets.}

      \field{abstract}{1. An oculomotor delayed-response task was used to examine the spatial memory functions of neurons in primate prefrontal cortex. Monkeys were trained to fixate a central spot during a brief presentation (0.5 s) of a peripheral cue and throughout a subsequent delay period (1-6 s), and then, upon the extinction of the fixation target, to make a saccadic eye movement to where the cue had been presented. Cues were usually presented in one of eight different locations separated by 45 degrees. This task thus requires monkeys to direct their gaze to the location of a remembered visual cue, controls the retinal coordinates of the visual cues, controls the monkey's oculomotor behavior during the delay period, and also allows precise measurement of the timing and direction of the relevant behavioral responses. 2. Recordings were obtained from 288 neurons in the prefrontal cortex within and surrounding the principal sulcus (PS) while monkeys performed this task. An additional 31 neurons in the frontal eye fields (FEF) region within and near the anterior bank of the arcuate sulcus were also studied. 3. Of the 288 PS neurons, 170 exhibited task-related activity during at least one phase of this task and, of these, 87 showed significant excitation or inhibition of activity during the delay period relative to activity during the intertrial interval. 4. Delay period activity was classified as directional for 79{\%} of these 87 neurons in that significant responses only occurred following cues located over a certain range of visual field directions and were weak or absent for other cue directions. The remaining 21{\%} were omnidirectional, i.e., showed comparable delay period activity for all visual field locations tested. Directional preferences, or lack thereof, were maintained across different delay intervals (1-6 s). 5. For 50 of the 87 PS neurons, activity during the delay period was significantly elevated above the neuron's spontaneous rate for at least one cue location; for the remaining 37 neurons only inhibitory delay period activity was seen. Nearly all (92{\%}) neurons with excitatory delay period activity were directional and few (8{\%}) were omnidirectional. Most (62{\%}) neurons with purely inhibitory delay period activity were directional, but a substantial minority (38{\%}) was omnidirectional. 6. Fifteen of the neurons with excitatory directional delay period activity also had significant inhibitory delay period activity for other cue directions. These inhibitory responses were usually strongest for, or centered about, cue directions roughly opposite those optimal for excitatory responses.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)}

      \field{abstract}{Working memory is critical to the integration of information across time in goal-directed behavior, reasoning and language, yet its neural substrate is unknown. Based on recent research, we propose a mechanism by which the brain can retain working memory for prospective use, thereby bridging time in the perception/action cycle. The essence of the mechanism is the activation of 'cognits', which consist of distributed, overlapping and interactive cortical networks that in the aggregate encode the long-term memory of the subject. Working memory depends on the excitatory reentry between perceptual and executive cognits of posterior and frontal cortices, respectively. Given the pervasive role of working memory in the structuring of purposeful cognitive sequences, its mechanism looms essential to the foundation of behavior, reasoning and language. {©} 2012.}

      \field{abstract}{The pFC enables the essential human capacities for predicting future events and preadapting to them. These capacities rest on both the structure and dynamics of the human pFC. Structurally, pFC, together with posterior association cortex, is at the highest hierarchical level of cortical organization, harboring neural networks that represent complex goal-directed actions. Dynamically, pFC is at the highest level of the perception-action cycle, the circular processing loop through the cortex that interfaces the organism with the environment in the pursuit of goals. In its predictive and preadaptive roles, pFC supports cognitive functions that are critical for the temporal organization of future behavior, including planning, attentional set, working memory, decision-making, and error monitoring. These functions have a common future perspective and are dynamically intertwined in goal-directed action. They all utilize the same neural infrastructure: a vast array of widely distributed, overlapping, and interactive cortical networks of personal memory and semantic knowledge, named cognits, which are formed by synaptic reinforcement in learning and memory acquisition. From this cortex-wide reservoir of memory and knowledge, pFC generates purposeful, goal-directed actions that are preadapted to predicted future events.}

      \field{abstract}{Choice confidence represents the degree of belief that one's actions are likely to be correct or rewarding and plays a critical role in optimizing our decisions. Despite progress in understanding the neurobiology of human perceptual decision-making, little is known about the representation of confidence. Importantly, it remains unclear whether confidence forms an integral part of the decision process itself or represents a purely post-decisional signal. To address this issue we employed a paradigm whereby on some trials, prior to indicating their decision, participants could opt-out of the task for a small but certain reward. This manipulation captured participants' confidence on individual trials and allowed us to discriminate between electroencephalographic signals associated with certain-vs.-uncertain trials. Discrimination increased gradually and peaked well before participants indicated their choice. These signals exhibited a temporal profile consistent with a process of evidence accumulation, culminating at time of peak discrimination. Moreover, trial-by-trial fluctuations in the accumulation rate of nominally identical stimuli were predictive of participants' likelihood to opt-out of the task, suggesting that confidence emerges from the decision process itself and is computed continuously as the process unfolds. Correspondingly, source reconstruction placed these signals in regions previously implicated in decision making, within the prefrontal and parietal cortices. Crucially, control analyses ensured that these results could not be explained by stimulus difficulty, lapses in attention or decision accuracy.}

      \field{abstract}{Unit recording studies in the lateral bank of the intraparietal cortex (area LIP) have demonstrated a response property not previously reported in posterior cortex. Studies were performed in the Rhesus monkey during tasks which required saccadic eye movements to remembered target locations in the dark. Neurons were found which remained active during the time period for which the monkey had to withhold eye movements while remembering desired target locations. The activity of the cells was tuned for eye movements of specific direction and amplitude, and it was not necessary for a visual stimulus to fall within the response field. The responses appeared to represent a memory-related motor-planning signal encoding motor error. The relation of the activity to the behavior of the animal suggests that the response represents the intent to make eye movements of specific direction and amplitude.}

      \field{abstract}{To make decisions about sensory stimuli, the brain must weigh the evidence that supports or opposes the alternative interpretations. In the present study, we evaluated the hypothesis that a quantity reflecting the weight of sensory evidence is represented in brain circuits responsible for the behavioral response used to indicate the decision. We trained monkeys to decide the direction of random-dot motion and to indicate their decision with an eye movement to one of two choice targets. We interrupted decision formation with electrical microstimulation of the frontal eye field, causing an evoked eye movement that is influenced by ongoing oculomotor activity. For the "pro-saccade" version of the task, in which the correct target was at a known location in the direction of motion, the microstimulus-evoked eye movement reflected both the impending pro-saccadic response and the temporal accumulation of motion information used to select that response. In contrast, for the "colored-target" task, in which the correct target was of a particular color but at an unpredictable location, little ongoing oculomotor activity was evident. The results suggest that formation of the decision and formation of the behavioral response share a common level of neural organization, but only when the decision is associated with a specific, predictable movement.}

      \field{abstract}{Although magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) have been available for decades, their relative merits are still debated. We examined regional differences in signal-to-noise-ratios (SNRs) of cortical sources in MEG and EEG. Data from four subjects were used to simulate focal and extended sources located on the cortical surface reconstructed from high-resolution magnetic resonance images. The SNR maps for MEG and EEG were found to be complementary. The SNR of deep sources was larger in EEG than in MEG, whereas the opposite was typically the case for superficial sources. Overall, the SNR maps were more uniform for EEG than for MEG. When using a noise model based on uniformly distributed random sources on the cortex, the SNR in MEG was found to be underestimated, compared with the maps obtained with noise estimated from actual recorded MEG and EEG data. With extended sources, the total area of cortex in which the SNR was higher in EEG than in MEG was larger than with focal sources. Clinically, SNR maps in a patient explained differential sensitivity of MEG and EEG in detecting epileptic activity. Our results emphasize the benefits of recording MEG and EEG simultaneously.}

      \field{abstract}{In the presence of normal sensory and motor capacity, intelligent behavior is widely acknowledged to develop from the interaction of short-and long-term memory. While the behavioral, cellular, and molecular underpinnings of the long-term memory process have long been associated with the hippocampal formation, and this structure has become a major model system for the study of memory (Bliss and Lomo, 1973; McNaughton and Nadel, 1990; Squire and Zola-Morgan, 1991), the neural substrates of specific short-term memory functions have more and more become identified with prefrontal cortical areas (Goldman-Rakic, 1987; Fuster, 1989). The special nature of working memory was first identified in studies of human cognition (e.g., Norman, 1970; Baddeley, 1986), and modern neuro-biological methods have identified a specific population of neurons, patterns of their intrinsic and extrinsic circuitry, and signaling molecules that are engaged in this process in animals. In this article, I will first define key features of working memory and then descdbe its biological basis in primates.}

      \field{abstract}{Extensive work in humans using magneto- and electroencephalography strongly suggests that decreased oscillatory $\alpha$-activity (8-14 Hz) facilitates processing in a given region, whereas increased $\alpha$-activity serves to actively suppress irrelevant or interfering processing. However, little work has been done to understand how $\alpha$-activity is linked to neuronal firing. Here, we simultaneously recorded local field potentials and spikes from somatosensory, premotor, and motor regions while a trained monkey performed a vibrotactile discrimination task. In the local field potentials we observed strong activity in the $\alpha$-band, which decreased in the sensorimotor regions during the discrimination task. This $\alpha$-power decrease predicted better discrimination performance. Furthermore, the $\alpha$-oscillations demonstrated a rhythmic relation with the spiking, such that firing was highest at the trough of the $\alpha$-cycle. Firing rates increased with a decrease in $\alpha$-power. These findings suggest that $\alpha$-oscillations exercise a strong inhibitory influence on both spike timing and firing rate. Thus, the pulsed inhibition by $\alpha$-oscillations plays an important functional role in the extended sensorimotor system.}

      \field{abstract}{Successful working memory (WM) requires the engagement of relevant brain areas but possibly also the disengagement of irrelevant areas. We used magnetoencephalography (MEG) to elucidate the temporal dynamics of areas involved in a somatosensory WM task. We found an increase in gamma band activity in the primary and secondary somatosensory areas during encoding and retention, respectively. This was accompanied by an increase of alpha band activity over task-irrelevant regions including posterior and ipsilateral somatosensory cortex. Importantly, the alpha band increase was strongest during successful WM performance. Furthermore, we found frontal gamma band activity that correlated both with behavioral performance and the alpha band increase. We suggest that somatosensory gamma band activity reflects maintenance and attention-related components of WM operations, whereas alpha band activity reflects frontally controlled disengagement of task-irrelevant regions. Our results demonstrate that resource allocation involving the engagement of task-relevant and disengagement of task-irrelevant regions is needed for optimal task execution.}

      \field{abstract}{Previous work on perceptual decision making in the sensorimotor system has shown population dynamics in the beta band, corre-sponding to the encoding of stimulus properties and the final decision outcome. Here, we asked how oscillatory dynamics in the medial premotor cortex (MPC) contribute to supramodal perceptual decision making. We recorded local field potentials (LFPs) and spikes in two monkeys trained to perform a tactile–acoustic frequency discrimination task, including both unimodal and crossmodal condi-tions. We studied the role of oscillatory activity as a function of stimulus properties (frequency and sensory modality), as well as decision outcome. We found that beta-band power correlated with relevant stimulus properties: there was a significant modulation by stimulus frequency during the working-memory (WM) retention in-terval, as well as modulation by stimulus modality—the latter was observed only in the case of a purely unimodal task, where modality information was relevant to prepare for the upcoming second stim-ulus. Furthermore, we found a significant modulation of beta power during the comparison and decision period, which was predictive of decision outcome. Finally, beta-band spike–field coherence (SFC) matched these LFP observations. In conclusion, we demonstrate that beta power in MPC is reflective of stimulus features in a supramo-dal, context-dependent manner, and additionally reflects the deci-sion outcome. We propose that these beta modulations are a signature of the recruitment of functional neuronal ensembles, which encode task-relevant information. beta oscillations | perceptual decision making | working memory | supramodal | LFP P erceptual decision making has been studied extensively in the monkey sensorimotor system using a vibrotactile discrimina-tion task (1–3). Spike activity in somatosensory, (pre)motor, and prefrontal regions has been linked to various task aspects, including stimulus encoding (4, 5), working-memory (WM) maintenance (6, 7), and comparison (8–10). Population dynamics in this same paradigm have been studied using local field potential (LFP) and magnetoencephalography and electroencephalography recordings, showing oscillatory modulations in alpha (8–14 Hz) and beta bands (15–30 Hz) related to various task aspects: alpha sets the state of the system, with decreased alpha in task-relevant areas related to increased spike activity and improved performance (11, 12), while beta modulations correspond to the encoding of stimulus proper-ties (13, 14) and the final decision outcome (refs. 15 and 16; for review, see ref. 17). Combined, these studies paint a picture of a dynamic, distributed network of areas contributing to the various stages of the perceptual decision-making process. Recently, this framework has been extended to the multimodal case: if the subject has to discriminate stimuli from different modalities, where and how is the modality-specific information transformed into a supramodal signal, allowing for comparison across modalities? In a tactile–acoustic version of the discrimina-tion task, it was shown that while early sensory regions only en-code information from their principal modality (18), neurons in premotor cortex encode information in a supramodal sense, that is, using the same representation to maintain information from either modality in WM (19). Furthermore, an EEG study in human subjects, using visual, tactile, and auditory unimodal flutter dis-crimination, reported parametric modulation of prefrontal beta power by stimulus frequency, regardless of modality, during WM retention (20). Thus, these studies suggest that task-relevant stimulus properties are encoded in a modality-nonspecific way in prefrontal regions, allowing for subsequent supramodal perceptual judgment. Here, we asked how oscillatory dynamics contribute to the supramodal perceptual decision process. We recorded LFPs and spikes in medial premotor cortex (MPC) in two animals per-forming a tactile–acoustic flutter discrimination task. We studied the role of oscillatory activity—specifically, alpha and beta bands— as a function of stimulus properties (frequency and sensory mo-dality) and decision outcome. We demonstrate that beta power in MPC is reflective of stimulus features in a context-dependent manner, and the subsequent decision outcome. This information is coded in a supramodal manner: modality information is only retained when relevant for the task at hand.}

      \field{abstract}{When humans respond to sensory stimulation, their reaction times tend to be long and variable relative to neural transduction and transmission times. The neural processes responsible for the duration and variability of reaction times are not understood. Single-cell recordings in a motor area of the cerebral cortex in behaving rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) were used to evaluate two alternative mathematical models of the processes that underlie reaction times. Movements were initiated if and only if the neural activity reached a specific and constant threshold activation level. Stochastic variability in the rate at which neural activity grew toward that threshold resulted in the distribution of reaction times. This finding elucidates a specific link between motor behavior and activation of neurons in the cerebral cortex.}

Sanders (sanders{\{}at{\}}cshl.edu) and Adam Kepecs1 (kepecs{\{}at{\}}cshl.edu) Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory ↵* Corresponding author; email: kepecs{\{}at{\}}cshl.edu AbstractDecision confidence is a forecast about the probability that a decision will be correct. For human decision makers, confidence is a deeply subjective sense that can be difficult to study due to its inherently introspective nature. However, confidence can be framed as an objective mathematical quantity—the Bayesian posterior probability, providing a formal definition of statistical decision confidence. Here we use this definition as a starting point to develop a normative statistical framework for decision confidence. We analytically prove interrelations between statistical decision confidence and other observable decision measures. Among these is a counterintuitive property of confidence—that the lowest average confidence occurs when classifiers err in the presence of the strongest evidence. These results lay the foundations for a mathematically rigorous treatment of decision confidence that can lead to a common framework for understanding confidence across different research domains, from human behavior to neural representations.Received March 31, 2015.Accepted April 1, 2015.{©} 2015, Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory PressThe copyright holder for this pre-print is the author.

      \field{abstract}{A central goal of cognitive neuroscience is to elucidate the neural mechanisms underlying decision-making. Recent physiological studies suggest that neurons in association areas may be involved in this process. To test this, we measured the effects of electrical microstimulation in the lateral intraparietal area (LIP) while monkeys performed a reaction-time motion discrimination task with a saccadic response. In each experiment, we identified a cluster of LIP cells with overlapping response fields (RFs) and sustained activity during memory-guided saccades. Microstimulation of this cluster caused an increase in the proportion of choices toward the RF of the stimulated neurons. Choices toward the stimulated RF were faster with microstimulation, while choices in the opposite direction were slower. Microstimulation never directly evoked saccades, nor did it change reaction times in a simple saccade task. These results demonstrate that the discharge of LIP neurons is causally related to decision formation in the discrimination task.}

      \field{abstract}{Perceptual decision making is the process by which animals detect, discriminate, and categorize information from the senses. Over the past two decades, understanding how perceptual decisions are made has become a central theme in the neurosciences. Exceptional progress has been made by recording from single neurons in the cortex of the macaque monkey and using computational models from mathematical psychology to relate these neural data to behavior. More recently, however, the range of available techniques and paradigms has dramatically broadened, and researchers have begun to harness new approaches to explore how rodents and humans make perceptual decisions. The results have illustrated some striking convergences with findings from the monkey, but also raised new questions and provided new theoretical insights. In this review, we summarize key findings, and highlight open challenges, for understanding perceptual decision making in rodents, monkeys, and humans.}

      \field{abstract}{Face perception, perhaps the most highly developed visual skill in humans, is mediated by a distributed neural system in humans that is comprised of multiple, bilateral regions. We propose a model for the organization of this system that emphasizes a distinction between the representation of invariant and changeable aspects of faces. The representation of invariant aspects of faces underlies the recognition of individuals, whereas the representation of changeable aspects of faces, such as eye gaze, expression, and lip movement, underlies the perception of information that facilitates social communication. The model is also hierarchical insofar as it is divided into a core system and an extended system. The core system is comprised of occipitotemporal regions in extrastriate visual cortex that mediate the visual analysis of faces. In the core system, the representation of invariant aspects is mediated more by the face-responsive region in the fusiform gyrus, whereas the representation of changeable aspects is mediated more by the face-responsive region in the superior temporal sulcus. The extended system is comprised of regions from neural systems for other cognitive functions that can be recruited to act in concert with the regions in the core system to extract meaning from faces.}

      \field{abstract}{Perceptual confidence refers to the degree to which we believe in the accuracy of our percepts. Signal detection theory suggests that perceptual confidence is computed from an internal "decision variable," which reflects the amount of available information in favor of one or another perceptual interpretation of the sensory input. The neural processes underlying these computations have, however, remained elusive. Here, we used fMRI and multivariate decoding techniques to identify regions of the human brain that encode this decision variable and confidence during a visual motion discrimination task. We used observers{\&}apos; binary perceptual choices and confidence ratings to reconstruct the internal decision variable that governed the subjects{\&}apos; behavior. A number of areas in prefrontal and posterior parietal association cortex encoded this decision variable, and activity in the ventral striatum reflected the degree of perceptual confidence. Using a multivariate connectivity analysis, we demonstrate that patterns of brain activity in the right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex reflecting the decision variable were linked to brain signals in the ventral striatum reflecting confidence. Our results suggest that the representation of perceptual confidence in the ventral striatum is derived from a transformation of the continuous decision variable encoded in the cerebral cortex.}

      \field{abstract}{A new fMRI study by Heekeren and colleagues suggests that left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) contains a region that integrates sensory evidence supporting perceptual decisions. DLPFC meets two criteria posited by Heekeren et al. for such a region: (1) its activity is correlated in time with the output of sensory areas of the visual cortex measured simultaneously, and (2) as expected of an integrator, its activity is greater on trials for which the sensory evidence is substantial than on trials for which the sensory evidence is weak. Complementary experiments in humans and monkeys now offer a realistic hope of elucidating decision-making networks in the primate brain.}

      \field{abstract}{Perceptual decision making typically entails the processing of sensory signals, the formation of a decision, and the planning and execution of a motor response. Although recent studies in monkeys and humans have revealed possible neural mechanisms for perceptual decision making, much less is known about how the decision is subsequently transformed into a motor action and whether or not the decision is represented at an abstract level, i.e., independently of the specific motor response. To address this issue, we used functional MRI to monitor changes in brain activity while human subjects discriminated the direction of motion in random-dot visual stimuli that varied in coherence and responded with either button presses or saccadic eye movements. We hypothesized that areas representing decision variables should respond more to high- than to low-coherence stimuli independent of the motor system used to express a decision. Four areas were found that fulfilled this condition: left posterior dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), left posterior cingulate cortex, left inferior parietal lobule, and left fusifom/parahippocampal gyrus. We previously found that, when subjects made categorical decisions about degraded face and house stimuli, left posterior DLPFC showed a greater response to high- relative to low-coherence stimuli. Furthermore, the left posterior DLPFC appears to perform a comparison of signals from sensory processing areas during perceptual decision making. These data suggest that the involvement of left posterior DLPFC in perceptual decision making transcends both task and response specificity, thereby enabling a flexible link among sensory evidence, decision, and action.}

      \field{abstract}{Perceptual decisions based on the comparison of two vibrotactile frequencies have been extensively studied in non-human primates. Recently, we obtained corresponding findings from human oscillatory electroencephalography (EEG) activity in the form of choice-selective modulations of upper beta band amplitude in medial premotor areas. However, the research in non-human primates as well as its human counterpart was so far limited to decisions reported by button presses. Thus, here we investigated whether the observed human beta band modulation is specific to the response modality. We recorded EEG activity from participants who compared two sequentially presented vibrotactile frequencies (f1 and f2), and decided whether f2 {>} f1 or f2 {<} f1, by performing a horizontal saccade to either side of a computer screen. Contrasting time-frequency transformed EEG data between both choices revealed that upper beta band amplitude (∼24-32 Hz) was modulated by participants' choices before actual responses were given. In particular, "f2 {>} f1" choices were always associated with higher beta band amplitude than "f2 {<} f1" choices, irrespective of whether the choice was correct or not, and independent of the specific association between saccade direction and choice. The observed pattern of beta band modulation was virtually identical to our previous results when participants responded with button presses. In line with an intentional framework of decision making, the most likely sources of the beta band modulation were now, however, located in lateral as compared to medial premotor areas including the frontal eye fields. Hence, we could show that the choice-selective modulation of upper beta band amplitude is on the one hand consistent across different response modalities (i.e., same modulation pattern in similar frequency band), and on the other hand effector specific (i.e., modulation originating from areas involved in planning and executing saccades).}

      \field{abstract}{Comparisons of sequentially presented vibrotactile frequencies have been extensively studied using electrophysiological recordings in nonhuman primates. Whereas neural signatures for working memory aspects of such tasks were recently also identified in human oscillatory EEG activity, homologue correlates of the comparison process are yet unknown. Here, we recorded EEG activity while participants decided which of two sequentially presented vibrotactile stimuli had a higher frequency. Because choices in this type of task are known to be systematically biased by the time-order effect, we applied Bayesian modeling to account for individual choice behavior. Using model-based EEG analysis, we found that upper beta band amplitude (∼20-30 Hz) was modulated by participants' choices. The modulation emerged ∼750 msec before a behavioral response was given and was source-localized to premotor areas.Importantly, the choice-dependent modulation of beta band amplitude was invariant to different motor response mappings and reflected the categorical outcome of the subjective comparison between the two frequencies. Consistently, this pattern was evident for both correct and incorrect trials, indicating that the beta band amplitude mirrors the internal representation of the comparison outcome. Our data complement previous findings in nonhuman primates and corroborate that the beta band activity in premotor areas reflects the categorical outcome of a sensory comparison prior to translation into an effector-specific motor command.}

      \field{abstract}{Perceptual decisions arise from the activity of neurons distributed across brain circuits. But, decoding the mechanisms behind this cognitive operation across brain circuits has long posed a difficult problem. We recorded the neuronal activity of diverse cortical areas, while monkeys performed a vibrotactile discrimination task. We find that the encoding of the stimuli during the stimulus periods, working memory, and comparison periods is widely distributed across cortical areas. Notably, during the comparison and postponed decision report periods the activity of frontal brain circuits encode both the result of the sensory evaluation that corresponds to the monkey's possible choices and past information on which the decision is based. These results suggest that frontal lobe circuits are more engaged in the readout of sensory information from working memory, when it is required to be compared with other sensory inputs, than simply engaged in motor responses during this task. {©} 2010 Elsevier Inc.}

      \field{abstract}{Monkeys are able to discriminate the difference in frequency between two periodic mechanical vibrations applied sequentially to the fingertips. It has been proposed that this ability is mediated by the periodicity of the responses in the quickly adapting (QA) neurons of the primary somatosensory cortex (S1), instead of the average firing rates. We recorded from QA neurons of S1 while monkeys performed the vibrotactile discrimination task. We found that the periodic mechanical vibrations can be represented both in the periodicity and in the firing rate responses to varying degrees across the QA neuronal population. We then computed neurometric functions by using both the periodicity and the firing rate and sought to determine which of these two measures is associated with the psychophysical performance. We found that neurometric thresholds based on the firing rate are very similar to the animal's psychometric thresholds whereas neurometric thresholds based on periodicity are far lower than those thresholds. These results indicate that an observer could solve this task with a precision similar to that of the monkey, based only on the firing rate produced during the stimulus periods.}

      \field{abstract}{The events linking sensory discrimination to motor action remain unclear. It is not known, for example, whether the motor areas of the frontal lobe receive the result of the discrimination process from other areas or whether they actively participate in it. To investigate this, we trained monkeys to discriminate between two mechanical vibrations applied sequentially to the fingertips; here subjects had to recall the first vibration, compare it to the second one, and indicate with a hand/arm movement which of the two vibrations had the higher frequency. We recorded the activity of single neurons in medial premotor cortex (MPC) and found that their responses correlate with the diverse stages of the discrimination process. Thus, activity in MPC reflects the temporal evolution of the decision-making process leading to action selection during this perceptual task.}

      \field{abstract}{To successfully interact with objects in the environment, sensory evidence must be continuously acquired, interpreted, and used to guide appropriate motor responses. For example, when driving, a red light should motivate a motor command to depress the brake pedal. Single-unit recording studies have established that simple sensorimotor transformations are mediated by the same neurons that ultimately guide the behavioral response. However, it is also possible that these sensorimotor regions are the recipients of a modality-independent decision signal that is computed elsewhere. Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging and human observers to show that the time course of activation in a subregion of the right insula is consistent with a role in accumulating sensory evidence independently from the required motor response modality (saccade vs manual). Furthermore, a combination of computational modeling and simulations of the blood oxygenation level-dependent response suggests that this region is not simply recruited by general arousal or by the tonic maintenance of attention during the decision process. Our data thus raise the possibility that a modality-independent representation of sensory evidence may guide activity in effector-specific cortical areas before the initiation of a behavioral response.}

      \field{abstract}{Decision-making often requires the accumulation and maintenance of evidence over time. Although the neural signals underlying sensory processing have been studied extensively, little is known about how the brain accrues and holds these sensory signals to guide later actions. Previous work has suggested that neural activity in the lateral intraparietal area (LIP) of the monkey brain reflects the formation of perceptual decisions in a random dot direction-discrimination task in which monkeys communicate their decisions with eye-movement responses. We tested the hypothesis that decision-related neural activity in LIP represents the time integral of the momentary motion "evidence." By briefly perturbing the strength of the visual motion stimulus during the formation of perceptual decisions, we tested whether this LIP activity reflected a persistent, integrated "memory" of these brief sensory events. We found that the responses of LIP neurons reflected substantial temporal integration. Brief pulses had persistent effects on both the monkeys' choices and the responses of neurons in LIP, lasting up to 800 ms after appearance. These results demonstrate that LIP is involved in neural time integration underlying the accumulation of evidence in this task. Additional analyses suggest that decision-related LIP responses, as well as behavioral choices and reaction times, can be explained by near-perfect time integration that stops when a criterion amount of evidence has been accumulated. Temporal integration may be a fundamental computation underlying higher cognitive functions that are dissociated from immediate sensory inputs or motor outputs.}

      \field{abstract}{Comparing two stimuli that occur at different times demands the coordination of bottom-up and top-down processes. It has been hypothesized that the dorsolateral prefrontal (PFC) cortex, the likely source of top-down cortical influences, plays a key role in such tasks, contributing to both maintenance and sensory comparisons. We examined this hypothesis by recording from the PFC of monkeys comparing directions of two moving stimuli, S1 and S2, separated by a memory delay. We determined the contribution of the two principal cell types to these processes by classifying neurons into broad-spiking (BS) putative pyramidal cells and narrow-spiking (NS) putative local interneurons. During the delay, BS cells were more likely to exhibit anticipatory modulation and represent the remembered direction. While this representation was transient, appearing at different times in different neurons, it weakened when direction was not task relevant, suggesting its utility. During S2, both putative cell types showed comparison-related activity modulations. These modulations were of two types, each carried by different neurons, which either preferred trials with stimuli moving in the same direction or trials with stimuli of different directions. These comparison effects were strongly correlated with choice, suggesting their role in circuitry underlying decision making. These results provide the first demonstration of distinct contributions made by principal cell types to memory-guided perceptual decisions. During sensory stimulation both cell types represent behaviorally relevant stimulus features contributing to comparison and decision-related activity. However in the absence of sensory stimulation, putative pyramidal cells dominated, carrying information about the elapsed time and the preceding direction.}

      \field{abstract}{Brain imaging and electrophysiological recording studies in humans have reported discrete cortical regions in posterior ventral temporal cortex that respond preferentially to faces, buildings, and letters. These findings suggest a category-specific anatomically segregated modular organization of the object vision pathway. Here we present data from a functional MRI study in which we found three distinct regions of ventral temporal cortex that responded preferentially to faces and two categories of other objects, namely houses and chairs, and had a highly consistent topological arrangement. Although the data could be interpreted as evidence for separate modules, we found that each category also evoked significant responses in the regions that responded maximally to other stimuli. Moreover, each category was associated with its own differential pattern of response across ventral temporal cortex. These results indicate that the representation of an object is not restricted to a region that responds maximally to that object, but rather is distributed across a broader expanse of cortex. We propose that the functional architecture of the ventral visual pathway is not a mosaic of category-specific modules but instead is a continuous representation of information about object form that has a highly consistent and orderly topological arrangement.}

      \field{abstract}{Whereas much is known about how we categorize and reason based on absolute quantity, data exploring ratios of quantities, as in proportions and fractions, are comparatively sparse. Until recently, it remained elusive whether these two representations of number are connected, how proportions are implemented by neurons and how language shapes this code. New data derived with complementary methods and from different model systems now shed light on the mechanisms of magnitude ratio representations. A coding scheme for proportions has emerged that is remarkably reminiscent of the representation of absolute number. These novel findings suggest a sense for ratios that grants the brain automatic access to proportions independently of language and the format of presentation. {©} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.}

      \field{abstract}{BACKGROUND: fMRI Resting State Networks (RSNs) have gained importance in the present fMRI literature. Although their functional role is unquestioned and their physiological origin is nowadays widely accepted, little is known about their relationship to neuronal activity. The combined recording of EEG and fMRI allows the temporal correlation between fluctuations of the RSNs and the dynamics of EEG spectral amplitudes. So far, only relationships between several EEG frequency bands and some RSNs could be demonstrated, but no study accounted for the spatial distribution of frequency domain EEG.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In the present study we report on the topographic association of EEG spectral fluctuations and RSN dynamics using EEG covariance mapping. All RSNs displayed significant covariance maps across a broad EEG frequency range. Cluster analysis of the found covariance maps revealed the common standard EEG frequency bands. We found significant differences between covariance maps of the different RSNs and these differences depended on the frequency band.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our data supports the physiological and neuronal origin of the RSNs and substantiates the assumption that the standard EEG frequency bands and their topographies can be seen as electrophysiological signatures of underlying distributed neuronal networks.}

      \field{abstract}{Encoding and recall of memory sequences is an important process. Memory encoding is thought to occur by long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampus; however, it remains unclear how LTP, which has a time window for induction of ∼100 ms, could encode the linkage between sequential items that arrive with a temporal separation {>}100 ms. Here, we argue that LTP can underlie the learning of such memory sequences, provided the input to the hippocampus is from a cortical multi-item working memory buffer in which theta and gamma oscillations have an important role. In such a buffer, memory items that occurred seconds apart are represented with a temporal separation of 20-30 ms, thereby bringing them within the LTP window. The physiological and behavioral evidence for such a buffer will be reviewed.}

      \field{abstract}{Rhythms are a prominent signature of brain activity. Their expression is correlated with numerous examples of healthy information processing and their fluctuations are a marker of disease states. Yet, their causal or epiphenomenal role in brain function is still highly debated. We review recent studies showing brain rhythms are not always ‘rhythmic', by which we mean representative of repeated cycles of activity. Rather, high power and continuous rhythms in averaged signals can represent brief transient events on single trials whose density accumulates in the average. We also review evidence showing time-domain signals with vastly different waveforms can exhibit identical spectral-domain frequency and power. Further, non-oscillatory waveform feature can create spurious high spectral power. Knowledge of these possibilities is essential when interpreting rhythms and is easily missed without considering pre-processed data. Lastly, we discuss how these findings suggest new directions to pursue in our quest to discover the mechanism and meaning of brain rhythms.}

      \field{abstract}{We examined neural spike recordings from prefrontal cortex (PFC) while monkeys performed a delayed somatosensory discrimination task. In general, PFC neurons displayed great heterogeneity in response to the task. That is, although individual cells spiked reliably in response to task variables from trial-to-trial, each cell had idiosyncratic combinations of response properties. Despite the great variety in response types, some general patterns held. We used linear regression analysis on the spike data to both display the full heterogeneity of the data and classify cells into categories. We compared different categories of cells and found little difference in their ability to carry information about task variables or their correlation to behavior. This suggests a distributed neural code for the task rather than a highly modularized one. Along this line, we compared the predictions of two theoretical models to the data. We found that cell types predicted by both models were not represented significantly in the population. Our study points to a different class of models that should embrace the inherent heterogeneity of the data, but should also account for the nonrandom features of the population.}

      \field{abstract}{Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we found an area in the fusiform gyrus in 12 of the 15 subjects tested that was significantly more active when the subjects viewed faces than when they viewed assorted common objects. This face activation was used to define a specific region of interest individually for each subject, within which several new tests of face specificity were run. In each of five subjects tested, the predefined candidate "face area" also responded significantly more strongly to passive viewing of (1) intact than scrambled two-tone faces, (2) full front-view face photos than front-view photos of houses, and (in a different set of five subjects) (3) three-quarter-view face photos (with hair concealed) than photos of human hands; it also responded more strongly during (4) a consecutive matching task performed on three-quarter-view faces versus hands. Our technique of running multiple tests applied to the same region defined functionally within individual subjects provides a solution to two common problems in functional imaging: (1) the requirement to correct for multiple statistical comparisons and (2) the inevitable ambiguity in the interpretation of any study in which only two or three conditions are compared. Our data allow us to reject alternative accounts of the function of the fusiform face area (area "FF") that appeal to visual attention, subordinate-level classification, or general processing of any animate or human forms, demonstrating that this region is selectively involved in the perception of faces.}

      \field{abstract}{During decision making, neurons in multiple brain regions exhibit responses that are correlated with decisions1–6. However, it remains uncertain whether or not various forms of decision- related activity are causally related to decision making7–9. Here we address this question by recording and reversibly inactivating the lateral intraparietal (LIP) and middle temporal (MT) areas of rhesus macaques performing a motion direction discrimination task. Neurons in area LIP exhibited firing rate patterns that directly resembled the evidence accumulation process posited to govern decision making2,10, with strong correlations between their response fluctuations and the animal's choices. Neurons in area MT, in contrast, exhibited weak correlations between their response fluctuations and choices, and had firing rate patterns consistent with their sensory role in motion encoding1. The behavioural impact of pharmacological inactivation of each area was inversely related to their degree of decision-related activity: while inactivation of neurons in MT profoundly impaired psychophysical performance, inactivation in LIP had no measurable impact on decision-making performance, despite having silenced the very clusters that exhibited strong decision-related activity. Although LIP inactivation did not impair psychophysical behaviour, it did influence spatial selection and oculomotor metrics in a free-choice control task. The absence of an effect on perceptual decision making was stable over trials and sessions and was robust to changes in stimulus type and task geometry, arguing against several forms of compensation. Thus, decision-related signals in LIP do not appear to be critical for computing perceptual decisions, and may instead reflect secondary processes. Our findings highlight a dissociation between decision correlation and causation, showing that strong neuron-decision correlations do not necessarily offer direct access to the neural computations underlying decisions.}

      \field{abstract}{Our ability to make rapid decisions based on sensory information belies the complexity of the underlying computations. Recently, "accumulator" models of decision making have been shown to explain the activity of parietal neurons as macaques make judgments concerning visual motion. Unraveling the operation of a decision-making circuit, however, involves understanding both the responses of individual components in the neural circuitry and the relationships between them. In this functional magnetic resonance imaging study of the decision process in humans, we demonstrate that an accumulator model predicts responses to visual motion in the intraparietal sulcus (IPS). Significantly, the metrics used to define responses within the IPS also reveal distinct but interacting nodes in a circuit, including early sensory detectors in visual cortex, the visuomotor integration system of the IPS, and centers of cognitive control in the prefrontal cortex, all of which collectively define a perceptual decision-making network.}

      \field{abstract}{Analyses of intrinsic fMRI BOLD signal fluctuations reliably reveal correlated and anticorrelated functional networks in the brain. Because the BOLD signal is an indirect measure of neuronal activity and anticorrelations can be introduced by preprocessing steps, such as global signal regression, the neurophysiological significance of correlated and anticorrelated BOLD fluctuations is a source of debate. Here, we address this question by examining the correspondence between the spatial organization of correlated BOLD fluctuations and correlated fluctuations in electrophysiological high $\gamma$ power signals recorded directly from the cortical surface of 5 patients. We demonstrate that both positive and negative BOLD correlations have neurophysiological correlates reflected in fluctuations of spontaneous neuronal activity. Although applying global signal regression to BOLD signals results in some BOLD anticorrelations that are not apparent in the ECoG data, it enhances the neuronal-hemodynamic correspondence overall. Together, these findings provide support for the neurophysiological fidelity of BOLD correlations and anticorrelations.}

      \field{abstract}{We frequently need to make timely decisions based on sensory evidence that is weak, ambiguous, or noisy resulting from conditions in the external environment (e.g., a cluttered visual scene) or within the brain itself (e.g., inattention, neural noise). Here we examine how externally and internally driven variations in the quality of sensory evidence affect the build-to-threshold dynamics of a supramodal "decision variable" signal and, hence, the timing and accuracy of decision reports in humans. Observers performed a continuous-monitoring version of the prototypical two-alternative dot-motion discrimination task, which is known to strongly benefit from sequential sampling and temporal accumulation of evidence. A centroparietal positive potential (CPP), which we previously established as a supramodal decision signal based on its invariance to motor or sensory parameters, exhibited two key identifying properties associated with the "decision variable" long described in sequential sampling models: (1) its buildup rate systematically scaled with sensory evidence strength across four levels of motion coherence, consistent with temporal integration; and (2) its amplitude reached a stereotyped level at the moment of perceptual report executions, consistent with a boundary-crossing stopping criterion. The buildup rate of the CPP also strongly predicted reaction time within coherence levels (i.e., independent of physical evidence strength), and this endogenous variation was linked with attentional fluctuations indexed by the level of parieto-occipital alpha-band activity preceding target onset. In tandem with the CPP, build-to-threshold dynamics were also observed in an effector-selective motor preparation signal; however, the buildup of this motor-specific process significantly lagged that of the supramodal process.}

      \field{abstract}{In the last two decades, animal neurophysiology research has made great strides towards explaining how the brain can enable adaptive action in the face of noisy sensory information. In particular, this work has identified neural signals that perform the role of a 'decision variable' which integrates sensory information in favor of a particular outcome up to an action-triggering threshold, consistent with long-standing predictions from mathematical psychology. This has provoked an intensive search for similar neural processes at work in the human brain. In this paper we review the progress that has been made in tracing the dynamics of perceptual decision formation in humans using functional imaging and electrophysiology. We highlight some of the limitations that non-invasive recording techniques place on our ability to make definitive judgments regarding the role that specific signals play in decision making. Finally, we provide an overview of our own work in this area which has focussed on two perceptual tasks - intensity change detection and motion discrimination - performed under continuous-monitoring conditions, and highlight the insights gained thus far. We show that through simple paradigm design features such as avoiding sudden intensity transients at evidence onset, a neural instantiation of the theoretical decision variable can be directly traced in the form of a centro-parietal positivity (CPP) in the standard event-related potential (ERP). We recapitulate evidence for the domain-general nature of the CPP process, being divorced from the sensory and motor requirements of the task, and re-plot data of both tasks highlighting this aspect as well as its relationship to decision outcome and reaction time. We discuss the implications of these findings for mechanistically principled research on normal and abnormal decision making in humans.}

      \field{abstract}{Neurons compute and communicate by transforming synaptic input patterns into output spike trains. The nature of this transformation depends crucially on the properties of voltage-gated conductances in neuronal membranes. These intrinsic membrane conductances can enable neurons to generate different spike patterns including brief, high-frequency bursts that are commonly observed in a variety of brain regions. Here we examine how the membrane conductances that generate bursts affect neural computation and encoding. We simulated a bursting neuron model driven by random current input signal and superposed noise. We consider two issues: the timing reliability of different spike patterns and the computation performed by the neuron. Statistical analysis of the simulated spike trains shows that the timing of bursts is much more precise than the timing of single spikes. Furthermore, the number of spikes per burst is highly robust to noise. Next we considered the computation performed by the neuron: how different features of the input current are mapped into specific output spike patterns. Dimensional reduction and statistical classification techniques were used to determine the stimulus features triggering different firing patterns. Our main result is that spikes, and bursts of different durations, code for different stimulus features, which can be quantified without a priori assumptions about those features. These findings lead us to propose that the biophysical mechanisms of spike generation enables individual neurons to encode different stimulus features into distinct spike patterns.}

      \field{abstract}{Brief bursts of high-frequency action potentials represent a common firing mode of pyramidal neurons, and there are indications that they represent a special neural code. It is therefore of interest to determine whether there are particular spatial and temporal features of neuronal inputs that trigger bursts. Recent work on pyramidal cells indicates that bursts can be initiated by a specific spatial arrangement of inputs in which there is coincident proximal and distal dendritic excitation (Larkum et al., 1999). Here we have used a computational model of an important class of bursting neurons to investigate whether there are special temporal features of inputs that trigger bursts. We find that when a model pyramidal neuron receives sinusoidally or randomly varying inputs, bursts occur preferentially on the positive slope of the input signal. We further find that the number of spikes per burst can signal the magnitude of the slope in a graded manner. We show how these computations can be understood in terms of the biophysical mechanism of burst generation. There are several examples in the literature suggesting that bursts indeed occur preferentially on positive slopes (Guido et al., 1992; Gabbiani et al., 1996). Our results suggest that this selectivity could be a simple consequence of the biophysics of burst generation. Our observations also raise the possibility that neurons use a burst duration code useful for rapid information transmission. This possibility could be further examined experimentally by looking for correlations between burst duration and stimulus variables.}

      \field{abstract}{To make a visual discrimination, the brain must extract relevant information from the retina, represent appropriate variables in the visual cortex and read out this representation to decide which of two or more alternatives is more likely. We recorded from neurons in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (areas 8 and 46) of the rhesus monkey while it performed a motion discrimination task. The monkey indicated its judgment of direction by making appropriate eye movements. As the monkey viewed the motion stimulus, the neural response predicted the monkey's subsequent gaze shift, hence its judgment of direction. The response comprised a mixture of high-level oculomotor signals and weaker visual sensory signals that reflected the strength and direction of motion. This combination of sensory integration and motor planning could reflect the conversion of visual motion information into a categorical decision about direction and thus give insight into the neural computations behind a simple cognitive act.}

      \field{abstract}{Neurons that fire high-frequency bursts of spikes are found in various sensory systems. Although the functional implications of burst firing might differ from system to system, bursts are often thought to represent a distinct mode of neuronal signalling. The firing of bursts in response to sensory input relies on intrinsic cellular mechanisms that work with feedback from higher centres to control the discharge properties of these cells. Recent work sheds light on the information that is conveyed by bursts about sensory stimuli, on the cellular mechanisms that underlie bursting, and on how feedback can control the firing mode of burst-capable neurons, depending on the behavioural context. These results provide strong evidence that bursts have a distinct function in sensory information transmission.}

      \field{abstract}{Glial cells are an integral part of functional communication in the brain. Here we show that astrocytes contribute to the fast dynamics of neural circuits that underlie normal cognitive behaviors. In particular, we found that the selective expression of tetanus neurotoxin (TeNT) in astrocytes significantly reduced the duration of carbachol-induced gamma oscillations in hippocampal slices. These data prompted us to develop a novel transgenic mouse model, specifically with inducible tetanus toxin expression in astrocytes. In this in vivo model, we found evidence of a marked decrease in electroencephalographic (EEG) power in the gamma frequency range in awake-behaving mice, whereas neuronal synaptic activity remained intact. The reduction in cortical gamma oscillations was accompanied by impaired behavioral performance in the novel object recognition test, whereas other forms of memory, including working memory and fear conditioning, remained unchanged. These results support a key role for gamma oscillations in recognition memory. Both EEG alterations and behavioral deficits in novel object recognition were reversed by suppression of tetanus toxin expression. These data reveal an unexpected role for astrocytes as essential contributors to information processing and cognitive behavior.}

      \field{abstract}{Recent studies have reported that sensory cortices process more than one sensory modality, challenging the long-lasting concept that they process only one. However, both the identity of these multimodal responses and whether they contribute to perceptual judgments is unclear. We recorded from single neurons in somatosensory cortices and primary auditory cortex while trained monkeys discriminated, on interleaved trials, either between two tactile flutter stimuli or between two acoustic flutter stimuli, and during discrimination sets that combined these two sensory modalities. We found neurons in these sensory cortices that responded to stimuli that are not of their principal sensory modality during these tasks. However, the identity of the stimulus could only be decoded from responses to their principal sensory modality during the stimulation periods and not during the processing steps that link sensation and decision making. These results suggest that multimodal encoding and perceptual judgments in these tasks occur outside the sensory cortices studied here. {©} 2010 Elsevier Inc.}

      \field{abstract}{It is widely assumed that the short-term retention of information is accomplished via maintenance of an active neural trace. However, we demonstrate that memory can be preserved across a brief delay despite the apparent loss of sustained representations. Delay period activity may, in fact, reflect the focus of attention, rather than STM. We unconfounded attention and memory by causing external and internal shifts of attention away from items that were being actively retained. Multivariate pattern analysis of fMRI indicated that only items within the focus of attention elicited an active neural trace. Activity corresponding to representations of items outside the focus quickly dropped to baseline. Nevertheless, this information was remembered after a brief delay. Our data also show that refocusing attention toward a previously unattended memory item can reactivate its neural signature. The loss of sustained activity has long been thought to indicate a disruption of STM, but our results suggest that, even for small memory loads not exceeding the capacity limits of STM, the active maintenance of a stimulus representation may not be necessary for its short-term retention.}

      \field{abstract}{We studied the corticocortical connections of architectonically defined areas of parietal and temporoparietal cortex, with emphasis on areas in the intraparietal sulcus (IPS) that are implicated in visual and somatosensory integration. Retrograde tracers were injected into selected areas of the IPS, superior temporal sulcus, and parietal lobule. The distribution of labeled cells was charted in relation to architectonically defined borders throughout the hemisphere and displayed on computer-generated three-dimensional reconstructions and on cortical flat maps. Injections centered in the ventral intraparietal area (VIP) revealed a complex pattern of inputs from numerous visual, somatosensory, motor, and polysensory areas, and from presumed vestibular- and auditory-related areas. Sensorimotor projections were predominantly from the upper body representations of at least six somatotopically organized areas. In contrast, injections centered in the neighboring ventral lateral intraparietal area (LIPv) revealed inputs mainly from extrastriate visual areas, consistent with previous studies. The pattern of inputs to LIPv largely overlapped those to zone MSTdp, a newly described subdivision of the medial superior temporal area. These results, in conjunction with those from injections into other parietal areas (7a, 7b, and anterior intraparietal area), support the fine-grained architectonic partitioning of cortical areas described in the preceding study. They also support and extend previous evidence for multiple distributed networks that are implicated in multimodal integration, especially with regard to area VIP.}

      \field{abstract}{The hippocampus is composed of several regions, each of which is a network of 105 to 106 neurons. The pattern of excitatory synaptic connections within and between regions has been determined, and the wiring diagram is shown in Figure 1. The intricacies are striking and beg for explanation, but it remains unclear how the connections work together to perform a function. Indeed, more generally, the goal of relating network connectivity to function has not been achieved for any region of the vertebrate central nervous system, with the exception of the retina. For many brain regions, the goal is a distant one, because not even the function of the region is known. For the hippocampus, the goal appears attainable, because the general function of the hippocampus in memory processes is established. Many models that relate aspects of hippocampal circuitry to memory function have have been proposed, and these have become more refined as new information has been learned about the cellular, network, and functional properties of the hippocampus (Jarrard 1993; O'Keefe and Recce 1993; Buzs{á} ki and Chrobak 1995; Muller 1996; Eichenbaum 1997; Nadel and Moscovitch 1997; Squire and Zola 1998; Tulving and Markowitsch 1998). In this paper, I propose a model that builds on several previous ones and is the first attempt to provide a coherent explanation of all of the connections shown in Figure 1. Wiring Diagram of the Excitatory Pathways of the Hippocampal Region In trying to relate hippocampal circuitry to memory function, it is important to understand that there are several different kinds of memory and that the hippocampus stores only episodic memories, memories that can be formed during a single occurrence, can be articulated (in humans), and that are linked to the particular context in which the event(s) occurred (Dore et al. 1998; Tulving and Markowitsch 1998). The hippocampus appears to be a long lasting and perhaps permanent repository of a high-level representation of these memories (reviewed by Nadel and Moscovitch 1997). Through feedback connections to the cortex, hippocampal neurons can activate a more detailed, lower-level representation that is stored in the cortex. Evidence that will be summarized in the following paragraphs indicates that the hippocampus may be especially important in the episodic memory of sequences. An example of such a memory would be: at the zoo (context), Jerry dropped his candy (memory 1), the monkey in the cage grabbed it (memory 2), and Jerry was sad (memory 3).The Phase-Advance of Hippocampal Place Cells May Reflect the Recall of Sequences Organized by Theta (510 Hz) and Gamma ({\~{}}40 Hz) Oscillations Reciprocally Interacting Heteroassociative and Autoassociative Networks Produce More Accurate Sequence Recall Than a Single Heteroassociative Network One observation that at first did not seem to fit with the idea that the phase-advance is generated in CA3 is that it is also observed in the preceding region, the dentate gyrus (Skaggs and McNaughton 1996). One possible explanation would be that the information is sent to the dentate from CA3 by the feedback connections (Figure 1). But what would be the purpose of such feedback, and, in the larger sense, what is the purpose of having two reciprocally connected recurrent networks? Although the influence of CA3 on the dentate has been demonstrated in vivo (Penttonen et al. 1997), this interaction has not yet been described in any detail. More data will therefore be required to determine whether the reciprocal interactions can perform the functions required by the model (see preliminary ideas in Figure 3C legend). What can be evaluated from available data is whether the proposed bidirectional interaction is feasible from a timing standpoint. If each step in sequence recall is linked to one gamma cycle (Figure 2), the bidirectional interaction must occur in less than the period of the oscillation (25 ms). The evidence suggests that this is feasible, since transmission from CA3 to the dentate takes {<}3 ms (Wu et al. 1998), and transmission back to CA3 takes {<}5 ms (Yeckel and Berger 1990). I now turn to the possible function of the direct input from the entorhinal cortex to CA3 (Figure 1). This input is called the perforant path input, and I argue that it has a key role in allowing memory sequences to be stored in context. Context refers to the general, relatively constant features of the environment. In our example, the zoo is the context. Cotton candy and animal smells are part of what makes up context. The importance of the hippocampus in encoding contextual information has been demonstrated in behavioral experiments. For instance, during aversive conditioning; given a choice of environments, normal animals will move to the environment in which they were not shocked when a conditioned stimulus is given. After hippocampal lesions, animals can still be conditioned, but actions based on context are absent (Selden et al. 1991). The importance of context is also evident in recordings from hippocampal place cells. In a given context, the environment is mapped out by a subset of place cells. In a different context (e.g., room), the environment will be mapped out by a different subset (Muller and Kubie 1987). About one-third of the cells are potentially active in a given context (Thompson and Best 1989). This strong context dependence is not observed in the entorhinal cortex (Quirk et al. 1992). Importantly, there are no cells in the hippocampus that fire continuously in a particular context. One explanation is that contextual input to the hippocampus is itself subthreshold. Such a subthreshold depolarization could, however, have important consequences in enabling context-appropriate cells to be triggered by other inputs.The Role of Dentate Synapses in Filtering Out Context and the Role of the Perforant Path to CA3 in Transmitting Context A prediction of this model is that a single mossy fiber input can fire a CA3 cell provided it is positively biased by context. So much is known about hippocampal firing patterns and about the anatomical connections between the dentate and CA3 that insight into this prediction can be gained by trying to account for the firing pattern in CA3 from that in the dentate. About 0.4{\%} of granule cells and 2.5{\%} of CA3 cells are active when the animal is at a given place (Barnes 1990). Each CA3 cell receives input from {\~{}}50 granule cells (Claiborne et al. 1986). From the binomial distribution, one can calculate that 17{\%} of CA3 cells will receive one or more active mossy fiber inputs, 1.7{\%} will receive two or more, and {<}0.1{\%} will receive three or more. Assume that of these, only one-third are positively biased by context; the remaining two-thirds are not biased and are therefore silent (Thompson and Best 1989). Thus, the expected percentage of CA3 cells firing in these three cases is 6{\%}, 0.6{\%}, or {<}{<}0.1{\%}. Since the observed value is 2.5{\%}, the possibility that two or more mossy fibers are required to fire a CA3 cell does not appear feasible. From this analysis, it is unlikely that more than one active mossy fiber input is needed to fire a CA3 cell (various sources of failure could lower the probability from 6{\%} to 2.5{\%}). Under some conditions (after removal of the dentate), mossy fiber input may not be at all necessary to fire CA3 cells, since place-specific firing persists (McNaughton et al. 1989). However, it is unclear whether this is a normal operating mode of the hippocampus or is due to compensations resulting from destruction of the dentate. What is known is that during the memory readout (when the phase-advance occurs), the dentate is active and therefore likely to contribute to the firing of CA3 cells (Skaggs and McNaughton 1996). The CA1 region receives information from CA3 and provides output to the entorhinal cortex. One role of the region is therefore to convey information derived from hippocampal computations back to the cortex. It has been proposed that as part of this process, CA1 acts as a decoder (McClelland and Goddard 1996). The underlying assumption is that the hippocampus and cortex do not use the same representation of information and that CA1 helps to convert the representation back to one that the cortex can understand. The term representation has to do with how cells combine different kinds of information. To use an illustrative example (Figure 4a), there may be cells in the hippocampus that represent the conjunction of Jerry and his feeling of sadness, whereas in the cortex, separate groups of cells encode Jerry and sadness. One purpose of such a change in representation may be to condense representations so that fewer cells encode any given memory. This orthogonalization reduces interference between different memories (McNaughton and Morris 1987; Rolls 1996; Hasselmo and Wyble 1997). The evidence is fairly good that a change in representation of incoming information occurs. First, place fields in the hippocampus are smaller than in entorhinal cortex; and second, anatomically distinct subregions of entorhinal cortex, which presumably carry different types of information, converge on individual granule cells (see Johnston and Amaral 1998). The strongest direct evidence for a representation change between CA3 and CA1 is anatomical, based on the resegregation in CA1 of specialized medial and lateral perforant path streams of information that had converged in the dentate and CA3 (Naber and Witter 1998). What remains lacking is physiological evidence for this change in representation. Indeed, the identical size of place fields in CA3 and CA1 argues to the contrary. Perhaps now that it is clear that the rat hippocampus encodes features other than spatial position (Eichenbaum 1996), more studies will be done on nonspatial variables, and these may reveal differences between CA1 and CA3 representations. The view that emerges of the hippocampus is a relatively simple one that can be related to the functional requir}

      \field{abstract}{Psychophysical measurements indicate that human subjects can store approximately seven short-term memories. Physiological studies suggest that short-term memories are stored by patterns of neuronal activity. Here it is shown that activity patterns associated with multiple memories can be stored in a single neural network that exhibits nested oscillations similar to those recorded from the brain. Each memory is stored in a different high-frequency ("40 hertz") subcycle of a low-frequency oscillation. Memory patterns repeat on each low-frequency (5 to 12 hertz) oscillation, a repetition that relies on activity-dependent changes in membrane excitability rather than reverberatory circuits. This work suggests that brain oscillations are a timing mechanism for controlling the serial processing of short-term memories.}

      \field{abstract}{Sequential sampling models provide a useful framework for understanding human decision making. A key component of these models is an evidence accumulation process in which information is accrued over time to a threshold, at which point a choice is made. Previous neurophysiological studies on perceptual decision making have suggested accumulation occurs only in sensorimotor areas involved in making the action for the choice. Here we investigated the neural correlates of evidence accumulation in the human brain using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while manipulating the quality of sensory evidence, the response modality, and the foreknowledge of the response modality. We trained subjects to perform a random dot motion direction discrimination task by either moving their eyes or pressing buttons to make their responses. In addition, they were cued about the response modality either in advance of the stimulus or after a delay. We isolated fMRI responses for perceptual decisions in both independently defined sensorimotor areas and task-defined nonsensorimotor areas. We found neural signatures of evidence accumulation, a higher fMRI response on low coherence trials than high coherence trials, primarily in saccade-related sensorimotor areas (frontal eye field and intraparietal sulcus) and nonsensorimotor areas in anterior insula and inferior frontal sulcus. Critically, such neural signatures did not depend on response modality or foreknowledge. These results help establish human brain areas involved in evidence accumulation and suggest that the neural mechanism for evidence accumulation is not specific to effectors. Instead, the neural system might accumulate evidence for particular stimulus features relevant to a perceptual task.}

      \field{abstract}{Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is widely used to study the operational organization of the human brain, but the exact relationship between the measured fMRI signal and the underlying neural activity is unclear. Here we present simultaneous intracortical recordings of neural signals and fMRI responses. We compared local field potentials (LFPs), single- and multi-unit spiking activity with highly spatio-temporally resolved blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI responses from the visual cortex of monkeys. The largest magnitude changes were observed in LFPs, which at recording sites characterized by transient responses were the only signal that significantly correlated with the haemodynamic response. Linear systems analysis on a trial-by-trial basis showed that the impulse response of the neurovascular system is both animal- and site-specific, and that LFPs yield a better estimate of BOLD responses than the multi-unit responses. These findings suggest that the BOLD contrast mechanism reflects the input and intracortical processing of a given area rather than its spiking output.}

      \field{abstract}{The development of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has brought together a broad community of scientists interested in measuring the neural basis of the human mind. Because fMRI signals are an indirect measure of neural activity, interpreting these signals to make deductions about the nervous system requires some understanding of the signaling mechanisms. We describe our current understanding of the causal relationships between neural activity and the blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal, and we review how these analyses have challenged some basic assumptions that have guided neuroscience. We conclude with a discussion of how to use the BOLD signal to make inferences about the neural signal.}

      \field{abstract}{In recent electroencephalography (EEG) studies, the vibrotactile frequency comparison task has been used to study oscillatory signatures of perceptual decision making in humans, revealing a choice-selective modulation of premotor upper beta band power shortly before decisions were reported. Importantly, these studies focused on decisions that were (1) indicated immediately after stimulus presentation, and (2) for which a direct motor mapping was provided. Here, we investigated whether the putative beta band choice signal also extends to postponed decisions, and how such a decision signal might be influenced by a response mapping that is dissociated from a specific motor command. We recorded EEG data in two separate experiments, both employing the vibrotactile frequency comparison task with delayed decision reports. In the first experiment, delayed choices were associated with a fixed motor mapping, whereas in the second experiment, choices were mapped onto a color code concealing a specific motor response until the end of the delay phase. In between stimulus presentations, as well as after the second stimulus, prefrontal beta band power indexed stimulus information held in working memory. Beta band power also encoded choices during the response delay, notably, in different cortical areas depending on the provided response mapping. In particular, when decisions were associated with a specific motor mapping, choices were represented in premotor cortices, whereas the color mapping resulted in a choice-selective modulation of beta band power in parietal cortices. Together, our findings imply that how a choice is expressed (i.e., the decision consequence) determines where in the cortical sensorimotor hierarchy an according decision signal is processed.}

      \field{abstract}{We sought to determine the neural code(s) for frequency discrimination of vibrotactile stimuli. We tested five possible candidate codes by analyzing the responses of single neurons recorded in primary somatosensory cortex of trained monkeys while they discriminated between two consecutive vibrotactile stimuli. Differences in the frequency of two stimuli could be discriminated using information from (i) time intervals between spikes, (ii) average spiking rate during each stimulus, (iii) absolute number of spikes elicited by each stimulus, (iv) average rate of bursts of spikes or ( v) absolute number of spike bursts elicited by each stimulus. However, only a spike count code, in which spikes are integrated over a time window that has most of its mass in the first 250 ms of each stimulus period, covaried with behavior on a trial-by-trial basis, was consistent with psychophysical biases induced by manipulation of stimulus duration, and produced neurometric discrimination thresholds similar to behavioral psychophysical thresholds.}

      \field{abstract}{Persistent spiking has been thought to underlie working memory (WM). However, virtually all of the evidence for this comes from studies that averaged spiking across time and across trials, which masks the details. On single trials, activity often occurs in sparse transient bursts. This has important computational and functional advantages. In addition, examination of more complex tasks reveals neural coding in WM is dynamic over the course of a trial. All this suggests that spiking is important for WM, but that its role is more complex than simply persistent spiking.Dual Perspectives Companion Paper:Persistent Spiking Activity Underlies Working Memory, by Christos Constantinidis, Shintaro Funahashi, Daeyeol Lee, John D.

      \field{abstract}{Working memory (WM) activity is not as stationary or sustained as previously thought. There are brief bursts of gamma ({\~{}}50–120 Hz) and beta ({\~{}}20–35 Hz) oscillations, the former linked to stimulus information in spiking. We examined these dynamics in relation to readout and control mechanisms of WM. Monkeys held sequences of two objects in WM to match to subsequent sequences. Changes in beta and gamma bursting suggested their distinct roles. In anticipation of having to use an object for the match decision, there was an increase in gamma and spiking information about that object and reduced beta bursting. This readout signal was only seen before relevant test objects, and was related to premotor activity. When the objects were no longer needed, beta increased and gamma decreased together with object spiking information. Deviations from these dynamics predicted behavioral errors. Thus, beta could regulate gamma and the information in WM.}

      \field{abstract}{Working memory is thought to result from sustained neuron spiking. However, computational models suggest complex dynamics with discrete oscillatory bursts. We analyzed local field potential (LFP) and spiking from the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of monkeys performing a working memory task. There were brief bursts of narrow-band gamma oscillations (45–100 Hz), varied in time and frequency, accompanying encoding and re-activation of sensory information. They appeared at a minority of recording sites associated with spiking reflecting the to-be-remembered items. Beta oscillations (20–35 Hz) also occurred in brief, variable bursts but reflected a default state interrupted by encoding and decoding. Only activity of neurons reflecting encoding/decoding correlated with changes in gamma burst rate. Thus, gamma bursts could gate access to, and prevent sensory interference with, working memory. This supports the hypothesis that working memory is manifested by discrete oscillatory dynamics and spiking, not sustained activity.}

      \field{abstract}{The perception of faces is sometimes regarded as a specialized task involving discrete brain regions. In an attempt to identi{\$} face-specific cortex, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure activation evoked by faces presented in a continuously changing montage of common objects or in a similar montage of nonobjects. Bilateral regions of the posterior fusiform gyrus were activated by faces viewed among nonobjects, but when viewed among objects, faces activated only a focal right fusiform region. To determine whether this focal activation would occur for another category of familiar stimuli, subjects viewed flowers presented among nonobjects and objects. While flowers among nonobjects evoked bilateral fusiform activation, flowers among objects evoked no activation. These results demonstrate that both faces and flowers activate large and partially overlapping regions of inferior extrastriate cortex. A smaller region, located primarily in the right lateral fusiform gyrus, is activated ...}

      \field{abstract}{The insula is a brain structure implicated in disparate cognitive, affective, and regulatory functions, including interoceptive awareness, emotional responses, and empathic processes. While classically considered a limbic region, recent evidence from network analysis suggests a critical role for the insula, particularly the anterior division, in high-level cognitive control and attentional processes. The crucial insight and view we present here is of the anterior insula as an integral hub in mediating dynamic interactions between other large-scale brain networks involved in externally oriented attention and internally oriented or self-related cognition. The model we present postulates that the insula is sensitive to salient events, and that its core function is to mark such events for additional processing and initiate appropriate control signals. The anterior insula and the anterior cingulate cortex form a "salience network" that functions to segregate the most relevant among internal and extrapersonal stimuli in order to guide behavior. Within the framework of our network model, the disparate functions ascribed to the insula can be conceptualized by a few basic mechanisms: (1) bottom-up detection of salient events, (2) switching between other large-scale networks to facilitate access to attention and working memory resources when a salient event is detected, (3) interaction of the anterior and posterior insula to modulate autonomic reactivity to salient stimuli, and (4) strong functional coupling with the anterior cingulate cortex that facilitates rapid access to the motor system. In this manner, with the insula as its integral hub, the salience network assists target brain regions in the generation of appropriate behavioral responses to salient stimuli. We suggest that this framework provides a parsimonious account of insula function in neurotypical adults, and may provide novel insights into the neural basis of disorders of affective and social cognition.}

      \field{abstract}{Primate visual cortex is hierarchically organized. Bottom-up and top-down influences are exerted through distinct frequency channels, as was recently revealed in macaques by correlating inter-areal influences with laminar anatomical projection patterns. Because this anatomical data cannot be obtained in human subjects, we selected seven homologous macaque and human visual areas, and we correlated the macaque laminar projection patterns to human inter-areal directed influences as measured with magnetoencephalography. We show that influences along feedforward projections predominate in the gamma band, whereas influences along feedback projections predominate in the alpha-beta band. Rhythmic inter-areal influences constrain a functional hierarchy of the seven homologous human visual areas that is in close agreement with the respective macaque anatomical hierarchy. Rhythmic influences allow an extension of the hierarchy to 26 human visual areas including uniquely human brain areas. Hierarchical levels of ventral- and dorsal-stream visual areas are differentially affected by inter-areal influences in the alpha-beta band. Michalareas et al. show that in human visual cortex influences along feedforward projections predominate in the gamma band, whereas influences along feedback projections predominate in the alpha-beta band. These influences constrain a functional hierarchy in agreement with macaque anatomical hierarchy.}

      \field{abstract}{It is usually assumed that enhanced spiking activity in the form of persistent reverberation for several seconds is the neural correlate of working memory. Here, we propose that working memory is sustained by calcium-mediated synaptic facilitation in the recurrent connections of neocortical networks. In this account, the presynaptic residual calcium is used as a buffer that is loaded, refreshed, and read out by spiking activity. Because of the long time constants of calcium kinetics, the refresh rate can be low, resulting in a mechanism that is metabolically efficient and robust. The duration and stability of working memory can be regulated by modulating the spontaneous activity in the network.}

      \field{abstract}{Several decades of psychophysical and neurophysiological studies have established that visual signals are enhanced at the locus of attention. What remains a mystery is the mechanism that initiates biases in the strength of visual representations. Recent evidence argues that, during spatial attention, these biases reflect nascent saccadic eye movement commands. We examined the functional interaction of saccade preparation and visual coding by electrically stimulating sites within the frontal eye fields (FEF) and measuring its effect on the activity of neurons in extrastriate visual cortex. Here we show that visual responses in area V4 could be enhanced after brief stimulation of retinotopically corresponding sites within the FEF using currents below that needed to evoke saccades. The magnitude of the enhancement depended on the effectiveness of receptive field stimuli as well as on the presence of competing stimuli outside the receptive field. Stimulation of non-corresponding FEF representations could suppress V4 responses. The results suggest that the gain of visual signals is modified according to the strength of spatially corresponding eye movement commands.}

      \field{abstract}{Several lines of evidence suggest that planning eye movements and directing visuospatial attention share overlapping brain mech-anisms. This study tested whether spatial attention can be en-hanced by altering oculomotor signals within the brain. Monkeys performed a spatial attention task while neurons within the frontal eye field, an oculomotor area within prefrontal cortex, were electrically stimulated below the level at which eye movements are evoked. We found that we could improve the monkey's perfor-mance with microstimulation when, but only when, the object to be attended was positioned in the space represented by the cortical stimulation site. frontal eye fields ͉ microstimulation ͉ saccades ͉ target selection S patial attention allows us to selectively perceive stimuli at relevant locations at the expense of stimuli at other locations. In the visual system, neural correlates of this process can be observed at many stages (1–3), yet the source of these attentive signals remains unknown. Several lines of evidence suggest that planning an eye movement to a particular location can enhance the processing of visual stimuli at that location, regardless of whether the movement is actually carried out (4–7). If this is true, it should be possible to direct visual attention by modifying oculomotor signals within the brain. We attempted to modify the performance of monkeys trained to detect visual events by injecting subthreshold oculomotor signals into the brain. This was done via electrical stimulation of the frontal eye field (FEF), an area with known oculomotor involvement. We hypothesized that if oculomotor planning gives rise to attentional filtering of visual signals, stimulation of an oculomotor area at levels below the movement threshold should allocate attention to targets positioned in the part of space represented by neurons at the stimulation site. We chose the FEF for this experiment because of its known involvement in the programming of saccadic eye movements and in target selection (8, 9), its coherent map of visual space in oculomotor coordinates (10), and its dense connections with posterior visual areas, including posterior parietal cortex (11, 12). We trained two monkeys to make manual responses to signal the transient dimming (''blink'') of a peripheral visual target in the presence of flashing distractors (Fig. 1; ref. 13). We then tested the effects of FEF microstimulation on their performance. In each experimental session, we first determined the location in space to which suprathreshold microstimulation shifted the direction of gaze, defined here as the motor field (MF). We then lowered the current below the movement threshold level and tested the effects of subthreshold microstimulation on the mon-key's performance when the target was placed inside of the MF. We did this in the following way. During blink trials, a 100-ms subthreshold stimulation train preceded the dimming of the target. During ''catch'' trials, the stimulation still occurred, but the target did not blink. Randomly interleaved with these trials were control trials during which no stimulation occurred. During both stimulation and control trials we measured psychophysical thresholds, defined as the minimum luminance change in the target stimulus the monkey could detect. Methods Behavioral Task. In each trial, the monkey first fixated on the central fixation point and depressed a lever, at which time a}

      \field{abstract}{The capacities of humans and monkeys to discriminate between the frequencies of mechanical sinusoids delivered to the glabrous skin of the hand have been measured in psychophysical experiments. The 2 primates have similar capacities; they make discriminations with Weber fractions that change little over the frequency range from 20 to 200 Hz. The discriminatory capacities are similar whether stimuli are received passively or acquired actively. Combined experiments have been made in monkeys in which the electrical signs of the activity of quickly adapting (QA) and slowly adapting (SA) neurons of postcentral areas 3b and 1 were recorded, both in the working state as the animal made discriminations and in the irrelevant state in which the stimuli did not guide behavior. The neuronal responses were analyzed in terms of discharge rates, periodicities in the neuronal discharges, and harmonic contents. It was shown that discriminatory capacity depends upon the period lengths in the sets of periodically entrained activity evoked by stimuli readily discriminated, and not upon the small differences in rates of discharge evoked by those stimuli. The periodicities were shown by harmonic analysis to be sharply limited to stimulus frequencies. Low-frequency stimuli evoke periodicities at the second and third harmonics in some neurons, in addition to strongly periodic signals at the fundamental frequency of the stimuli. Their presence does not appear to interfere with frequency discrimination. Neuronal responses recorded in the stimulus-irrelevant state were not distinguishable from those recorded as monkeys made discriminations. The responses of SA neurons, recorded under similar conditions, resembled those of QA neurons in almost every feature, but reasons are given for concluding that the SA system plays no role in frequency discrimination in the sense of flutter.}

      \field{abstract}{Task preparation has traditionally been thought to rely upon persistent representations of instructions that permit their execution after delays. Accumulating evidence suggests, however, that accurate retention of task knowledge can be insufficient for successful performance. Here,we hypothesized that instructed facts would be organized into a task set; a temporary coding scheme that proactively tunes sensorimotor pathways according to instructions to enable highly efficient “reflex-like” performance.We devised a paradigm requiring either implementation or memorization of novel stimulus–response mapping instructions, and used multivoxel pattern analysis of neuroimaging data to compare neural coding of instructions during the pretarget phase. Although participants could retain instructions under both demands,we observed striking differences in their representation. To-be-memorized instructions could only be decoded from mid-occipital and posterior parietal cortices, consistent with previous workon visual short-termmemorystorage. In contrast, to-be-implemented instructions could also be decoded from frontoparietal “multiple-demand” regions, and dedicated visual areas, implicated in processing instructed stimuli. Neural specificity in the latter moreover correlated with performance speed only when instructions were prepared, likely reflecting the preconfiguration of instructed decision circuits. Together, these data illuminate how the brain proactively optimizes performance, and help dissociate neural mechanisms supporting task control and short-term memory storage.}

      \field{abstract}{This study sought to investigate the effects of manipulating social coordination on brain synchronization/de-synchronization in the mu band. Mu activation is associated with understanding and coordinating motor acts and may play a key role in mediating social interaction. Members of a dyad were required to interact with one another in a rhythmic finger movement coordination task under various instructions: intrinsic where each member of the dyad was instructed to maintain their own and ignore their partner's movement; in-phase where they were asked to synchronize with their partner's movement; and anti-phase where they were instructed to syncopate with their partner's movement. EEG and movement data were recorded simultaneously from both subjects during all three tasks and a control condition. Log power ratios of EEG activity in the active conditions versus control were used to assess the effect of task context on synchronization/de-synchronization in the mu spectral domain. Results showed clear and systematic modulation of mu band activity in the 10-12. Hz range as a function of coordination context. In the left hemisphere general levels of alpha-mu suppression increased progressively as one moved from intrinsic through in-phase to anti-phase contexts but with no specific central-parietal focus. In contrast the right hemisphere displayed context-specific changes in the central-parietal region. The intrinsic condition showed a right synchronization which disappeared with the in-phase context even as de-synchronization remained greater in the left hemisphere. Anti-phase was associated with larger mu suppression in the right in comparison with left at central-parietal region. Such asymmetrical changes were highly correlated with changing behavioral dynamics. These specific patterns of activation and deactivation of mu activity suggest that localized neural circuitry in right central-parietal regions mediates how individuals interpret the movements of others in the context of their own actions. A right sided mechanism in the 10-12. Hz range appears to be involved in integrating the mutual information among the members of a dyad that enables the dynamics of social interaction to unfold in time. {©} 2011 Elsevier Inc.}

      \field{abstract}{Somatosensory responses to vibrotactile stimulation applied to the index fingertip were recorded with whole-head MEG in eleven healthy young adult participants. Stimulus trains were produced by a pneumatically driven membrane oscillating at 22 Hz for a trial duration of 1 s, separated by interstimulus intervals (ISIs) of 0.5, 1.0, 3.0, and 7.0 s. Data analysis was performed in two frequency bands. Transient onset responses in the lower frequency band ({<}20 Hz) contained a clearly expressed P50 component. The higher frequency band (18-30 Hz) revealed a gamma-band response (GBR) within the first 200 ms followed by rhythmic activity at the stimulus frequency that continued throughout the stimulus duration, known as the steady-state response (SSR). Dipoles associated with the transient responses and SSRs were localized in two distinct regions within the primary somatosensory cortex (SI), with transient responses located on average 3 mm more medial and inferior than the SSRs. The transient and GBR peak amplitudes increased with ISI, whereas the SSR amplitude showed no ISI dependence. These results may reflect functionally and spatially distinct neural populations. Further investigations are required to assess the implications of these findings for probing the somatosensory system using other functional neuroimaging methods such as fMRI. {©} 2006 Elsevier Inc.

      \field{abstract}{This chapter reviews the progress that has been made in our understanding of the neuronal substrates and mechanisms of nonverbal numerical magnitude representations in primates. Item numbers can be determined in two fundamentally different spatio-temporal presentation formats. When presented simultaneously as in multiple-item patterns, numerosity can be estimated at a single glance in a direct, perceptual-like way from a spatial arrangement. Temporal and spatial cues were counterbalanced across trials to ensure they could not be used by the animals to solve the task. In addition to the previously described neurons selective to numerosity in multiple-dot patterns, roughly 25{\%} of the neurons in the fundus of the IPS also encoded sequentially presented numerical quantity. Neurons in the prefrontal and posterior parietal cortices are selectively tuned to abstract quantity, and the cellular response characteristics can explain basic psychophysical phenomena in dealing with them. Both during the sample and delay presentation, 25{\%} of the tested neurons were significantly tuned only to proportion, irrespective of the absolute lengths of the test and reference bars. {©} 2011 Elsevier Inc.

      \field{abstract}{During perceptual decisions, the activity of sensory neurons correlates with a subject's percept, even when the physical stimulus is identical. The origin of this correlation is unknown. Current theory proposes a causal effect of noise in sensory neurons on perceptual decisions, but the correlation could result from different brain states associated with the perceptual choice (a top-down explanation). These two schemes have very different implications for the role of sensory neurons in forming decisions. Here we use white-noise analysis to measure tuning functions of V2 neurons associated with choice and simultaneously measure how the variation in the stimulus affects the subjects' (two macaques) perceptual decisions. In causal models, stronger effects of the stimulus upon decisions, mediated by sensory neurons, are associated with stronger choice-related activity. However, we find that over the time course of the trial these measures change in different directions-at odds with causal models. An analysis of the effect of reward size also supports this conclusion. Finally, we find that choice is associated with changes in neuronal gain that are incompatible with causal models. All three results are readily explained if choice is associated with changes in neuronal gain caused by top-down phenomena that closely resemble attention. We conclude that top-down processes contribute to choice-related activity. Thus, even forming simple sensory decisions involves complex interactions between cognitive processes and sensory neurons.}

      \field{abstract}{In theoretical accounts of perceptual decision-making, a decision variable integrates noisy sensory evidence and determines action through a boundary-crossing criterion. Signals bearing these very properties have been characterized in single neurons in monkeys, but have yet to be directly identified in humans. Using a gradual target detection task, we isolated a freely evolving decision variable signal in human subjects that exhibited every aspect of the dynamics observed in its single-neuron counterparts. This signal could be continuously tracked in parallel with fully dissociable sensory encoding and motor preparation signals, and could be systematically perturbed mid-flight during decision formation. Furthermore, we found that the signal was completely domain general: it exhibited the same decision-predictive dynamics regardless of sensory modality and stimulus features and tracked cumulative evidence even in the absence of overt action. These findings provide a uniquely clear view on the neural determinants of simple perceptual decisions in humans.}

      \field{abstract}{Sequential sampling models have provided a dominant theoretical framework guiding computational and neurophysiological investigations of perceptual decision-making. While these models share the basic principle that decisions are formed by accumulating sensory evidence to a bound, they come in many forms that can make similar predictions of choice behaviour despite invoking fundamentally different mechanisms. The identification of neural signals that reflect some of the core computations underpinning decision formation offers new avenues for empirically testing and refining key model assumptions. Here, we highlight recent efforts to explore these avenues and, in so doing, consider the conceptual and methodological challenges that arise when seeking to infer decision computations from complex neural data.}

      \field{abstract}{Causal attribution of recent biological trends to climate change is complicated because non-climatic influences dominate local, short-term biological changes. Any underlying signal from climate change is likely to be revealed by analyses that seek systematic trends across diverse species and geographic regions; however, debates within the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reveal several definitions of a 'systematic trend'. Here, we explore these differences, apply diverse analyses to more than 1,700 species, and show that recent biological trends match climate change predictions. Global meta-analyses documented significant range shifts averaging 6.1 km per decade towards the poles (or metres per decade upward), and significant mean advancement of spring events by 2.3 days per decade. We define a diagnostic fingerprint of temporal and spatial 'sign-switching' responses uniquely predicted by twentieth century climate trends. Among appropriate long-term/large-scale/multi-species data sets, this diagnostic fingerprint was found for 279 species. This suite of analyses generates 'very high confidence' (as laid down by the IPCC) that climate change is already affecting living systems.}

      \field{abstract}{Sensory working memory consists of the short-term storage of sensory stimuli to guide behaviour. There is increasing evidence that elemental sensory dimensions - such as object motion in the visual system or the frequency of a sound in the auditory system - are stored by segregated feature-selective systems that include not only the prefrontal and parietal cortex, but also areas of sensory cortex that carry out relatively early stages of processing. These circuits seem to have a dual function: precise sensory encoding and short-term storage of this information. New results provide insights into how activity in these circuits represents the remembered sensory stimuli.}

      \field{abstract}{Blocking or desynchronization of the central beta rhythm prior to and parallel to voluntary movement was found in 31 of 33 normal subjects investigated. The beta blocking was short lasting (1-3 sec), very often accompanied by blocking of the mu rhythm and localized in the central region. Phasic beta desynchronization was also observed after somatosensory stimulation. The beta rhythm showed a bilateral symmetrical blocking pattern with unilateral movement or stimulation. Patients with unilateral cerebral ischaemia showed an asymmetric blocking response and therefore demonstrated a high degree of hemispheric independence of the rhythmic generating systems. Central beta desynchronization is, therefore, a normal physiological phenomenon caused by activation processes of the sensorimotor cortex and detectable on the scalp very easily with closely spaced electrodes. {©} 1981.}

      \field{abstract}{Simultaneous recordings of the EEG at subdural and scalp electrodes often show very different activities. Large amplitude activity with maximum power between 15 and 30 c/sec can be often observed on the subdural electrodes together with smaller amplitude lower frequencies, whereas on the scalp only a small part of this high frequency activity is seen and the lower frequencies dominate. The impedance between cortex and scalp has been shown to be similar for low and high EEG frequencies and the high attenuation of the ?? activity at scalp electrodes is believed to be due to summation of polyphasic cortical activity across a limited cortical area (spatial average) is similar to the activity of a non-recursive filter between cortex and scalp and has a low pass characteristic. ?? 1975.}

      \field{abstract}{The way that we interpret and interact with the world entails making decisions on the basis of available sensory evidence. Recent primate neurophysiology [1-6], human neuroimaging [7-13], and modeling experiments [14-19] have demonstrated that perceptual decisions are based on an integrative process in which sensory evidence accumulates over time until an internal decision bound is reached. Here we used repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to provide causal support for the role of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in this integrative process. Specifically, we used a speeded perceptual categorization task designed to induce a time-dependent accumulation of sensory evidence through rapidly updating dynamic stimuli and found that disruption of the left DLPFC with low-frequency rTMS reduced accuracy and increased response times relative to a sham condition. Importantly, using the drift-diffusion model, we show that these behavioral effects correspond to a decrease in drift rate, a parameter describing the rate and thereby the efficiency of the sensory evidence integration in the decision process. These results provide causal evidence linking the DLPFC to the mechanism of evidence accumulation during perceptual decision making. {©} 2011 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.}

      \field{abstract}{Single-unit animal studies have consistently reported decision-related activity mirroring a process of temporal accumulation of sensory evidence to a fixed internal decision boundary. To date, our understanding of how response patterns seen in single-unit data manifest themselves at the macroscopic level of brain activity obtained from human neuroimaging data remains limited. Here, we use single-trial analysis of human electroencephalography data to show that population responses on the scalp can capture choice-predictive activity that builds up gradually over time with a rate proportional to the amount of sensory evidence, consistent with the properties of a drift-diffusion-like process as characterized by computational modeling. Interestingly, at time of choice, scalp potentials continue to appear parametrically modulated by the amount of sensory evidence rather than converging to a fixed decision boundary as predicted by our model. We show that trial-to-trial fluctuations in these response-locked signals exert independent leverage on behavior compared with the rate of evidence accumulation earlier in the trial. These results suggest that in addition to accumulator signals, population responses on the scalp reflect the influence of other decision-related signals that continue to covary with the amount of evidence at time of choice.}

      \field{abstract}{Existing evidence indicates that mu and other alpha-like rhythms are independent phenomena because of differences in source generation, sensitivity to sensory events, bilateral coherence, frequency, and power. Although mu suppression and enhancement echo sensorimotor processing in frontoparietal networks, they are also sensitive to cognitive and affective influences and likely reflect more than an idling brain state. Mu rhythms are present at early stages of human development and in other mammalian species. They exhibit adaptive and dynamically changing properties, including frequency acceleration and posterior-to-anterior shifts in focus. Furthermore, individuals can learn to control mu rhythms volitionally in a very short period of time. This raises questions about the mu rhythm's open neural architecture and ability to respond to cognitive, affective, and motor imagery, implying an even greater developmental and functional role than has previously been ascribed to it. Recent studies have suggested that mu rhythms reflect downstream modulation of motor cortex by prefrontal mirror neurons, i.e., cells that may play a critical role in imitation learning and the ability to understand the actions of others. It is proposed that mu rhythms represent an important information processing function that links perception and action-specifically, the transformation of "seeing" and "hearing" into "doing." In a broader context, this transformation function results from an entrainment/gating mechanism in which multiple alpha networks (visual-, auditory-, and somatosensory-centered domains), typically producing rhythmic oscillations in a locally independent manner, become coupled and entrained. A global or 'diffuse and distributed alpha system' comes into existence when these independent sources of alpha become coherently engaged in transforming perception to action. {©} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

      \field{abstract}{We studied the timecourse of neural activity in the primate (Macacca mulatta) prefrontal (PF) cortex during an object delayed-matching-to-sample (DMS) task. To assess the effects of experience on this timecourse, we conducted the task using both novel and highly familiar objects. In addition, noise patterns containing no task-relevant information were used as samples on some trials. Comparison of average PF ensemble activity relative to baseline activity generated by objects and noise patterns revealed three distinct activity periods. (i) Sample onset elicited a transient sensory visual response. In this sensory period, novel objects elicited stronger average ensemble activity than both familiar objects and noise patterns. (ii) An intermediate period of elevated activity followed, which began before sample offset, and continued well into the delay period. In the intermediate period, activity was elevated for noise patterns and novel objects, but near baseline for familiar objects. (iii) Finally, after average ensemble activity reached baseline activity at the end of the intermediate period, a reactivation period occurred late in the delay. Experience had little effect during reactivation, where activity was elevated for both novel and familiar objects compared to noise patterns. We show that the ensemble average resembles the activity timecourse of many single prefrontal neurons. These results suggest that PF delay activity does not merely maintain recent sensory input, but is subject to more complex experience-dependent dynamics. This has implications for how delay activity is generated and maintained.}

      \field{abstract}{Encoding of visual information by LGN bursts. Thalamic relay cells respond to visual stimuli either in burst mode, as a result of activation of a low-threshold Ca2+ conductance, or in tonic mode, when this conductance is inactive. We investigated the role of these two response modes for the encoding of the time course of dynamic visual stimuli, based on extracellular recordings of 35 relay cells from the lateral geniculate nucleus of anesthetized cats. We presented a spatially optimized visual stimulus whose contrast fluctuated randomly in time with frequencies of up to 32 Hz. We estimated the visual information in the neural responses using a linear stimulus reconstruction method. Both burst and tonic spikes carried information about stimulus contrast, exceeding one bit per action potential for the highest variance stimuli. The "meaning" of an action potential, i.e., the optimal estimate of the stimulus at times preceding a spike, was similar for burst and tonic spikes. In within-trial comparisons, tonic spikes carried about twice as much information per action potential as bursts, but bursts as unitary events encoded about three times more information per event than tonic spikes. The coding efficiency of a neuron for a particular stimulus is defined as the fraction of the neural coding capacity that carries stimulus information. Based on a lower bound estimate of coding efficiency, bursts had approximately 1.5-fold higher efficiency than tonic spikes, or 3-fold if bursts were considered unitary events. Our main conclusion is that both bursts and tonic spikes encode stimulus information efficiently, which rules out the hypothesis that bursts are nonvisual responses.}

      \field{abstract}{Does the sustained, elevated neural activity observed during working memory tasks reflect the short-term retention of information? Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data of delayed recognition of visual motion in human participants were analyzed with two methods: a general linear model (GLM) and multivoxel pattern analysis. Although the GLM identified sustained, elevated delay-period activity in superior and lateral frontal cortex and in intraparietal sulcus, pattern classifiers were unable to recover trial-specific stimulus information from these delay-active regions. The converse-no sustained, elevated delay-period activity but successful classification of trial-specific stimulus information-was true of posterior visual regions, including area MT+ (which contains both middle temporal area and medial superior temporal area) and calcarine and pericalcarine cortex. In contrast to stimulus information, pattern classifiers were able to extract trial-specific task instruction-related information from frontal and parietal areas showing elevated delay-period activity. Thus, the elevated delay-period activity that is measured with fMRI may reflect processes other than the storage, per se, of trial-specific stimulus information. It may be that the short-term storage of stimulus information is represented in patterns of (statistically) "subthreshold" activity distributed across regions of low-level sensory cortex that univariate methods cannot detect.}

      \field{abstract}{IN 1874 Ferrier (4) elicited conjugate contralateral eye movements in the monkey by stimulating the cortical area now known as the frontal eye fields (Brodmann's area 8). The many subsequent studies of this phenomenon have been reviewed by Smith (22) in 1949 and Crosby, Yoss, and Henderson (3) in 1952. The usual response to electrical stimulation was a slow rotation of both eyes to the opposite side with an occasional up or down component. Other types of movements that have been observed are centering (l), vergence movements (3), and nystagmus (22). Several cortical maps showed areas on the frontal cortex where these various types of movements could be produced but there was little agreement among them. Most of these studies suffered from three limitations: 1,) the animals were under light anesthesia which is known to affect the Movements; 2) stimulus intensity was usually unreported, and ?) eye movements were not objectively recorded. In 1958 Krieger, Wagman, and Bender (10) reported the effects of anesthesia on cortically evoked eye movements. Although they did not record eye movements, they reported (24) that stimulation of the frontal eye fields of the unanesthetized monkey usually produced the rapid eye movements called saccades. In 1966 we developed a method for accurately recording vertical and horizontal eye movement chronically in the monkey (6). Using it, we discovered that a brief stimulus delivered to the frontal eye fields produced a single con trala teral saccadic eye movement characterized by an amplitude, a direction, a latency, and a threshold (19). Consequently, we explored the effects of cortical location on all these variables}

      \field{abstract}{The amplitude of P300, and of other components of the evoked potentials, was examined during a task which required Ss to make a response appropriate to the conjoint properties of two rapidly successive visual patterns. In one set of conditions, the task was structured such that both stimuli were needed for the choice judgment. In another set of conditions, the task was changed from choice to simple RT by presenting the patterns in a predictable order. It was observed that P300 was enhanced during the choice RT conditions and that this enhancement was present only for the P300 following the stimulus permitting the choice and not the other, relevant but not decisive, stimulus appearing in close temporal proximity. An appreciable degree of independence between P300 and other components was indicated by the appearance of P300 under conditions in which other evoked potential components were entirely refractory. The data support an account for P300 in terms of poststimulus processes, such as decision making, and not in terms of preparatory adjustments.}

      \field{abstract}{Decisions about the visual world can take time to form, especially when information is unreliable. We studied the neural correlate of gradual decision formation by recording activity from the lateral intraparietal cortex (area LIP) of rhesus monkeys during a combined motion-discrimination reaction-time task. Monkeys reported the direction of random-dot motion by making an eye movement to one of two peripheral choice targets, one of which was within the response field of the neuron. We varied the difficulty of the task and measured both the accuracy of direction discrimination and the time required to reach a decision. Both the accuracy and speed of decisions increased as a function of motion strength. During the period of decision formation, the epoch between onset of visual motion and the initiation of the eye movement response, LIP neurons underwent ramp-like changes in their discharge rate that predicted the monkey's decision. A steeper rise in spike rate was associated with stronger stimulus motion and shorter reaction times. The observations suggest that neurons in LIP integrate time-varying signals that originate in the extrastriate visual cortex, accumulating evidence for or against a specific behavioral response. A threshold level of LIP activity appears to mark the completion of the decision process and to govern the tradeoff between accuracy and speed of perception.}

      \field{abstract}{Humans and monkeys have similar abilities to discriminate the difference in frequency between two mechanical vibrations applied sequentially to the fingertips. A key component of this sensory task is that the second stimulus is compared with the trace left by the first (base) stimulus, which must involve working memory. Where and how is this trace held in the brain? This question was investigated by recording from single neurons in the prefrontal cortex of monkeys while they performed the somatosensory discrimination task. Here we describe neurons in the inferior convexity of the prefrontal cortex whose discharge rates varied, during the delay period between the two stimuli, as a monotonic function of the base stimulus frequency. We describe this as 'monotonic stimulus encoding', and we suggest that the result may generalize: monotonic stimulus encoding may be the basic representation of one-dimensional sensory stimulus quantities in working memory. Thus we predict that other behavioural tasks that require ordinal comparisons between scalar analogue stimuli would give rise to monotonic responses similar to those reported here.}

      \field{abstract}{A fundamental problem in neurobiology is to understand how brain circuits represent sensory information and how such representations give rise to perception, memory and decision-making. We demonstrate that a sensory stimulus engages multiple areas of the cerebral cortex, including primary sensory, prefrontal, premotor and motor cortices. As information transverses the cortical circuits it shows progressively more relation to perception, memory and decision reports. In particular, we show how somatosensory areas on the parietal lobe generate a parameterized representation of a tactile stimulus. This representation is maintained in working memory by prefrontal and premotor areas of the frontal lobe. The presentation of a second stimulus, that monkeys are trained to compare with the first, generates decision-related activity reflecting which stimulus had the higher frequency. Importantly, decision-related activity is observed across several cortical circuits including prefrontal, premotor and parietal cortices. Sensory information is encoded by neuronal populations with opposite tuning, and suggests that a simple subtraction operation could be the underlying mechanism by which past and present sensory information is compared to generate perceptual decisions. {©} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.}

      \field{abstract}{The ventral premotor cortex (VPC) is involved in the transformation of sensory information into action, although the exact neuronal operation is not known. We addressed this problem by recording from single neurons in VPC while trained monkeys report a decision based on the comparison of two mechanical vibrations applied sequentially to the fingertips. Here we report that the activity of VPC neurons reflects current and remembered sensory inputs, their comparison, and motor commands expressing the result; that is, the entire processing cascade linking the evaluation of sensory stimuli with a motor report. These findings provide a fairly complete panorama of the neural dynamics that underlies the transformation of sensory information into an action and emphasize the role of VPC in perceptual decisions.}

      \field{abstract}{The ability to discriminate between two sequential stimuli requires evaluation of current sensory information in reference to stored information. Where and how does this evaluation occur? We trained monkeys to compare two mechanical vibrations applied sequentially to the fingertips and to report which of the two had the higher frequency. We recorded single neurons in secondary somatosensory cortex (S2) while the monkeys performed the task. During the first stimulus period, the firing rate of S2 neurons encoded the stimulus frequency. During the second stimulus period, however, some S2 neurons did not merely encode the stimulus frequency. The responses of these neurons were a function of both the remembered (first) and current (second) stimulus. Moreover, a few hundred milliseconds after the presentation of the second stimulus, these responses were correlated with the monkey's decision. This suggests that some S2 neurons may combine past and present sensory information for decision-making.}

      \field{abstract}{Neural oscillations at different frequencies have recently been related to a wide range of basic and higher cognitive processes. One possible role of oscillatory activity is to assure the maintenance of information in working memory (WM). Here we review the possibility that rhythmic activity at theta, alpha, and gamma frequencies serve distinct functional roles during WM maintenance. Specifically, we propose that gamma-band oscillations are generically involved in the maintenance of WM information. By contrast, alpha-band activity reflects the active inhibition of task-irrelevant information, whereas theta-band oscillations underlie the organization of sequentially ordered WM items. Finally, we address the role of cross-frequency coupling (CFC) in enabling alpha-gamma and theta-gamma codes for distinct WM information. {©} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.}

      \field{abstract}{The flutter sensation is felt when mechanical vibrations between 5 and 50 Hz are applied to the skin. Neurons with rapidly adapting properties in the somatosensory system of primates are driven very effectively by periodic flutter stimuli; their evoked spike trains typically have a periodic structure with highly regular time differences between spikes. A long-standing conjecture is that, such periodic structure may underlie a subject's capacity to discriminate the frequencies of periodic vibrotactile stimuli and that, in primary somatosensory areas, stimulus frequency is encoded by the regular time intervals between evoked spikes, not by the mean rate at which these are fired. We examined this hypothesis by analyzing extracellular recordings from primary (S1) and secondary (S2) somatosensory cortices of awake monkeys performing a frequency discrimination task. We quantified stimulus-driven modulations in firing rate and in spike train periodicity, seeking to determine their relevance for frequency discrimination. We found that periodicity was extremely high in S1 but almost absent in S2. We also found that periodicity was enhanced when the stimuli were relevant for behavior. However, periodicity did not covary with psychophysical performance in single trials. On the other hand, rate modulations were similar in both areas, and with periodic and aperiodic stimuli, they were enhanced when stimuli were important for behavior, and were significantly correlated with psychophysical performance in single trials. Thus, the exquisitely timed, stimulus-driven spikes of primary somatosensory neurons may or may not contribute to the neural code for flutter frequency, but firing rate seems to be an important component of it.}

      \field{abstract}{Neurons in the visual cortex respond selectively to perceptually salient features of the visual scene, such as the direction and speed of moving objects, the orientation of local contours, or the colour or relative depth of a visual pattern. It is commonly assumed that the brain constructs its percept of the visual scene from information encoded in the selective responses of such neurons. We have now tested this hypothesis directly by measuring the effect on psychophysical performance of modifying the firing rates of physiologically characterized neurons. We required rhesus monkeys to report the direction of motion in a visual display while we electrically stimulated clusters of directionally selective neurons in the middle temporal visual area (MT, or V5), an extrastriate area that plays a prominent role in the analysis of visual motion information. Microstimulation biased the animals' judgements towards the direction of motion encoded by the stimulated neurons. This result indicates that physiological properties measured at the neuronal level can be causally related to a specific aspect of perceptual performance.}

      \field{abstract}{Physiological and behavioral evidence suggests that the activity of direction selective neurons in visual cortex underlies the perception of moving visual stimuli. We tested this hypothesis by measuring the effects of cortical microstimulation on perceptual judgements of motion direction. To accomplish this, rhesus monkeys were trained to discriminate the direction of motion in a near-threshold, stochastic motion display. For each experiment, we positioned a microelectrode in the middle of a cluster of neurons that shared a common preferred direction of motion. The psychophysical task was then adjusted so that the visual display was presented directly over the neurons' receptive field. The monkeys were required to discriminate between motion shown either in the direction preferred by the neurons or in the opposite direction. On half the trials of an experiment, we applied electrical microstimulation while monkeys viewed the motion display. We hypothesized that enhancing the neurons' discharge rate would introduce a directionally specific signal into the cortex and thereby influence the monkeys' choices on the discrimination task. We compared the monkeys' performance on "stimulated" and "nonstimulated" trials in 139 experiments; all trials within an experiment were presented in random order. Statistically significant effects of microstimulation were obtained in 89 experiments. In 86 of the 89 experiments with significant effects (97{\%}), the monkeys indicated that motion was in the neurons' preferred direction more frequently on stimulated trials than on nonstimulated trials. The data demonstrate a functional link between the activity of direction selective neurons and perceptual judgements of motion direction.}

      \field{abstract}{Human confidence judgments are thought to originate from metacognitive processes that provide a subjective assessment about one's beliefs. Alternatively, confidence is framed in mathematics as an objective statistical quantity: the probability that a chosen hypothesis is correct. Despite similar terminology, it remains unclear whether the subjective feeling of confidence is related to the objective, statistical computation of confidence. To address this, we collected confidence reports from humans performing perceptual and knowledge-based psychometric decision tasks. We observed two counterintuitive patterns relating confidence to choice and evidence: apparent overconfidence in choices based on uninformative evidence, and decreasing confidence with increasing evidence strength for erroneous choices. We show that these patterns lawfully arise from statistical confidence, and therefore occur even for perfectly calibrated confidence measures. Furthermore, statistical confidence quantitatively accounted for human confidence in our tasks without necessitating heuristic operations. Accordingly, we suggest that the human feeling of confidence originates from a mental computation of statistical confidence. Sanders et al. show that human confidence judgments originate from the mental computation of statistical confidence in both a perceptual and a knowledge-based decision task.}

      \field{abstract}{We investigated how the brain selects the targets for eye movements, a process in which the outcome of visual processing is converted into guided action. Macaque monkeys were trained to make a saccade to fixate a salient target presented either alone or with multiple distractors during visual search. Neural activity was recorded in the frontal eye field, a cortical area at the interface of visual processing and eye movement production. Neurons discharging after stimulus presentation and before saccade initiation were analyzed. The initial visual response of frontal eye field neurons was modulated by the presence of multiple stimuli and by whether a saccade was going to be produced, but the initial visual response did not discriminate the target of the search array from the distractors. In the latent period before saccade initiation, the activity of most visually responsive cells evolved to signal the location of the target. Target selection occurred through suppression of distractor evoked activity contingent on the location of the target relative to the receptive field. The evolution of a signal specifying the location of the salient target could be dissociated from saccade initiation in some cells and could occur even when fixation was maintained. Neural activity in the frontal eye fields may participate in or be the product of the decision process guiding eye movements.}

      \field{abstract}{The primate visual system consists of at least two processing streams, one passing ventrally into temporal cortex that is responsible for object vision, and the other running dorsally into parietal cortex that is responsible for spatial vision. How information from these two streams is combined for perception and action is not understood. Visually guided eye movements require information about both feature identity and location, so we investigated the topographic organization of visual cortex connections with frontal eye field (FEF), the final stage of cortical processing for saccadic eye movements. Multiple anatomical tracers were placed either in parietal and temporal cortex or in different parts of FEF in individual macaque monkeys. Convergence from the dorsal and ventral processing streams occurred in lateral FEF but not in medial FEF. Certain extrastriate areas with retinotopic visual field organizations projected topographically onto FEF. The dorsal bank of the superior temporal sulcus projected to medial FEF; the ventral bank, to lateral FEF, and the fundus, throughout FEF. Thus, lateral FEF, which is responsible for generating short saccades, receives visual afferents from the foveal representation in retinotopically organized areas, from areas that represent central vision in inferotemporal cortex and from other areas having no retinotopic order. In contrast, medial FEF, which is responsible for generating longer saccades, is innervated by the peripheral representation of retinotopically organized areas, from areas that emphasize peripheral vision or are multimodal and from other areas that have no retinotopic order or are auditory.}

      \field{abstract}{Work on animals indicates that BOLD is preferentially sensitive to local field potentials, and that it correlates most strongly with gamma band neuronal synchronization. Here we investigate how the BOLD signal in humans performing a cognitive task is related to neuronal synchronization across different frequency bands. We simultaneously recorded EEG and BOLD while subjects engaged in a visual attention task known to induce sustained changes in neuronal synchronization across a wide range of frequencies. Trial-by-trial BOLD fluctuations correlated positively with trial-by-trial fluctuations in high-EEG gamma power (60. -80 Hz) and negatively with alpha and beta power. Gamma power on the one hand, and alpha and beta power on the other hand, independently contributed to explaining BOLD variance. These results indicate that the BOLD-gamma coupling observed in animals can be extrapolated to humans performing a task and that neuronal dynamics underlying high- and low-frequency synchronization contribute independently to the BOLD signal. {©} 2011 Elsevier Inc.}

      \field{abstract}{To understand how the brain handles mentally represented information flexibly in the absence of sensory stimulation, working memory (WM) studies have been essential. A seminal finding in monkey research is that neurons in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) retain stimulus-specific information when vibrotactile frequencies were memorized. A direct mapping between monkey studies and human research is still controversial. Although oscillatory signatures, in terms of frequency-dependent parametric beta-band modulation, have been observed recently in human EEG studies, the content specificity of these representations in terms of multivariate pattern analysis has not yet been shown. Here, we used fMRI in combination with multivariate classification techniques to determine which brain regions retain information during WM. In a retro-cue delayed-match-to-sample task, human subjects memorized the frequency of vibrotactile stimulation over a 12 s delay phase. Using an assumption-free whole-brain searchlight approach, we tested with support vector regression which brain regions exhibited multivariate parametric WM codes of the maintained frequencies during the WM delay. Interestingly, our analysis revealed an overlap with regions previously identified in monkeys composed of bilateral premotor cortices, supplementary motor area, and the right inferior frontal gyrus as part of the PFC. Therefore, our results establish a link between the WM codes found in monkeys and those in humans and emphasize the importance of the PFC for information maintenance during WM also in humans.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Working memory (WM) research in monkeys has identified a network of regions, including prefrontal regions, to code stimulus-specific information when vibrotactile frequencies are memorized. Here, we performed an fMRI study during which human subjects had to memorize vibratory frequencies in parallel to previous monkey research. Using an assumption-free, whole-brain searchlight decoding approach, we identified for the first time regions in the human brain that exhibit multivariate patterns of activity to code the vibratory frequency parametrically during WM. Our results parallel previous monkey findings and show that the supplementary motor area, premotor, and the right prefrontal cortex are involved in vibrotactile WM coding in humans.}

      \field{abstract}{Despite extensive work on the behavioral and physiological correlates of brain rhythms, it is still unresolved whether they have any important function in the mammalian cerebral cortex. In particular, there is no consensus on whether there are general computational roles for network oscillations. Three main possibilities will be discussed here. One possibility is that network oscillations contribute to representation of information. A second idea is that, rather than representing information as such, oscillations and synchrony regulate the flow of information in neural circuits. A third possibility is that oscillations assist in the storage and retrieval of information in neural circuits. These three possibilities are not mutually exclusive.}

      \field{abstract}{A decision is a commitment to a proposition or plan of action based on information and values associated with the possible outcomes. The process operates in a flexible timeframe that is free from the immediacy of evidence acquisition and the real time demands of action itself. Thus, it involves deliberation, planning, and strategizing. This Perspective focuses on perceptual decision making in nonhuman primates and the discovery of neural mechanisms that support accuracy, speed, and confidence in a decision. We suggest that these mechanisms expose principles of cognitive function in general, and we speculate about the challenges and directions before the field.}

      \field{abstract}{The aim of statistical decision theories is to understand how evidence, prior knowledge, and values lead an organism to commit to one of a number of alternatives. Two main statistical decision theories, signal-detection theory and sequential analysis, assert that decision makers obtain evidence—often from the senses—that is corrupted by noise and weigh this evidence alongside bias and value to select the best choice. Signal-detec- tion theory has been the dominant conceptual framework for perceptual decisions near threshold. Sequential analysis extends this framework by incorporating time and intro- ducing a rule for terminating the decision process. This extension allows the trade-off between decision speed and accuracy to be studied, and invites us to consider decision rules as policies on a stream of evidence acquired in time. In light of these theories, simple perceptual decisions, which can be studied in the neurophysiology laboratory, allow principles that apply to more complex decisions to be exposed. The goal of this chapter is to “go beyond the data” to postulate a number of unifying principles of complex decisions based on our fi ndings with simple decisions. We make speculative points and argue positions that should be viewed as controversial and pro- vocative. In many places, a viewpoint will merely be sketched without going into much detail and without ample consideration of alternatives, except by way of contrast when necessary to make a point. The aim is not to convince but to pique interest. The chapter is divided into two main sections. The fi rst suggests that an intention- based framework for decision making extends beyond simple perceptual decisions to a broad variety of more complex situations. The second, which is a logical extension of the fi rst, poses a challenge to Bayesian inference as the dominant mathematical founda- tion of decision making.}

      \field{abstract}{The primate visual system offers unprecedented opportunities for investigating the neural basis of cognition. Even the simplest visual discrimination task requires processing of sensory signals, formation of a decision, and orchestration of a motor response. With our extensive knowledge of the primate visual and oculomotor systems as a base, it is now possible to investigate the neural basis of simple visual decisions that link sensation to action. Here we describe an initial study of neural responses in the lateral intraparietal area (LIP) of the cerebral cortex while alert monkeys discriminated the direction of motion in a visual display. A subset of LIP neurons carried high-level signals that may comprise a neural correlate of the decision process in our task. These signals are neither sensory nor motor in the strictest sense; rather they appear to reflect integration of sensory signals toward a decision appropriate for guiding movement. If this ultimately proves to be the case, several fascinating issues in cognitive neuroscience will be brought under rigorous physiological scrutiny.}

      \field{abstract}{Cortical neurons exhibit tremendous variability in the number and temporal distribution of spikes in their discharge patterns. Furthermore, this variability appears to be conserved over large regions of the cerebral cortex, suggesting that it is neither reduced nor expanded from stage to stage within a processing pathway. To investigate the principles underlying such statistical homogeneity, we have analyzed a model of synaptic integration incorporating a highly simplified integrate and fire mechanism with decay. We analyzed a "high-input regime" in which neurons receive hundreds of excitatory synaptic inputs during each interspike interval. To produce a graded response in this regime, the neuron must balance excitation with inhibition. We find that a simple integrate and fire mechanism with balanced excitation and inhibition produces a highly variable interspike interval, consistent with experimental data. Detailed information about the temporal pattern of synaptic inputs cannot be recovered from the pattern of output spikes, and we infer that cortical neurons are unlikely to transmit information in the temporal pattern of spike discharge. Rather, we suggest that quantities are represented as rate codes in ensembles of 50-100 neurons. These column-like ensembles tolerate large fractions of common synaptic input and yet covary only weakly in their spike discharge. We find that an ensemble of 100 neurons provides a reliable estimate of rate in just one interspike interval (10-50 msec). Finally, we derived an expression for the variance of the neural spike count that leads to a stable propagation of signal and noise in networks of neurons-that is, conditions that do not impose an accumulation or diminution of noise. The solution implies that single neurons perform simple algebra resembling averaging, and that more sophisticated computations arise by virtue of the anatomical convergence of novel combinations of inputs to the cortical column from external sources.}

      \field{abstract}{Shadlen, Michael N. and William T. Newsome. Neural Basis of a Perceptual Decision in the Parietal Cortex (Area LIP) of the Rhesus Monkey. J. Neurophysiol. 86: 1916-1936, 2001. We recorded the activity of single neurons in the posterior parietal cortex (area LIP) of two rhesus monkeys while they discriminated the direction of motion in random-dot visual stimuli. The visual task was similar to a motion discrimination task that has been used in previous investigations of motion-sensitive regions of the extrastriate cortex. The monkeys were trained to decide whether the direction of motion was toward one of two choice targets that appeared on either side of the random-dot stimulus. At the end of the trial, the monkeys reported their direction judgment by making an eye movement to the appropriate target. We studied neurons in LIP that exhibited spatially selective persistent activity during delayed saccadic eye movement tasks. These neurons are thought to carry high-level signals appropriate for identifying salient visual targets and for guiding saccadic eye movements. We arranged the motion discrimination task so that one of the choice targets was in the LIP neuron's response field (RF) while the other target was positioned well away from the RF. During motion viewing, neurons in LIP altered their firing rate in a manner that predicted the saccadic eye movement that the monkey would make at the end of the trial. The activity thus predicted the monkey's judgment of motion direction. This predictive activity began early in the motion-viewing period and became increasingly reliable as the monkey viewed the random-dot motion. The neural activity predicted the monkey's direction judgment on both easy and difficult trials (strong and weak motion), whether or not the judgment was correct. In addition, the timing and magnitude of the response was affected by the strength of the motion signal in the stimulus. When the direction of motion was toward the RF, stronger motion led to larger neural responses earlier in the motion-viewing period. When motion was away from the RF, stronger motion led to greater suppression of ongoing activity. Thus the activity of single neurons in area LIP reflects both the direction of an impending gaze shift and the quality of the sensory information that instructs such a response. The time course of the neural response suggests that LIP accumulates sensory signals relevant to the selection of a target for an eye movement.}

      \field{abstract}{Persistent elevated neuronal activity has been identified as the neuronal correlate of working memory. It is generally assumed in the literature and in computational and theoretical models of working memory that memory-cell activity is stable and replicable; however, this assumption may be an artifact of the averaging of data collected across trials, and needs experimental verification. In this study, we introduce a classification scheme to characterize the firing frequency trends of cells recorded from the cortex of monkeys during performance of working memory tasks. We examine the frequency statistics and variability of firing during baseline and memory periods. We also study the behavior of cells on individual trials and across trials, and explore the stability of cellular firing during the memory period. We find that cells from different firing-trend classes possess markedly different statistics. We also find that individual cells show substantial variability in their firing behavior across trials, and that firing frequency also varies markedly over the course of a single trial. Finally, the average frequency distribution is wider, the magnitude of the frequency increases from baseline to memory smaller, and the magnitude of frequency decreases larger than is generally assumed. These results may serve as a guide in the evaluation of current theories of the cortical mechanisms of working memory. {©} 2007 IBRO.}

      \field{abstract}{During flexible behavior, multiple brain regions encode sensory inputs, the current task, and choices. It remains unclear how these signals evolve. We simultaneously recorded neuronal activity from six cortical regions [middle temporal area (MT), visual area four (V4), inferior temporal cortex (IT), lateral intraparietal area (LIP), prefrontal cortex (PFC), and frontal eye fields (FEF)] of monkeys reporting the color or motion of stimuli. After a transient bottom-up sweep, there was a top-down flow of sustained task information from frontoparietal to visual cortex. Sensory information flowed from visual to parietal and prefrontal cortex. Choice signals developed simultaneously in frontoparietal regions and travelled to FEF and sensory cortex. This suggests that flexible sensorimotor choices emerge in a frontoparietal network from the integration of opposite flows of sensory and task information.}

      \field{abstract}{Cognition results from interactions among functionally specialized but widely distributed brain regions; however, neuroscience has so far largely focused on characterizing the function of individual brain regions and neurons therein. Here we discuss recent studies that have instead investigated the interactions between brain regions during cognitive processes by assessing correlations between neuronal oscillations in different regions of the primate cerebral cortex. These studies have opened a new window onto the large-scale circuit mechanisms underlying sensorimotor decision-making and top-down attention. We propose that frequency-specific neuronal correlations in large-scale cortical networks may be 'fingerprints' of canonical neuronal computations underlying cognitive processes.}

      \field{abstract}{Goal-directed behavior requires the flexible transformation of sensory evidence about our environment into motor actions. Studies of perceptual decision-making have shown that this transformation is distributed across several widely separated brain regions. Yet, little is known about how decision-making emerges from the dynamic interactions among these regions. Here, we review a series of studies, in which we characterized the cortical network interactions underlying a perceptual decision process in the human brain. We used magnetoencephalography to measure the large-scale cortical population dynamics underlying each of the sub-processes involved in this decision: the encoding of sensory evidence and action plan, the mapping between the two, and the attentional selection of task-relevant evidence. We found that these sub-processes are mediated by neuronal oscillations within specific frequency ranges. Localized gamma-band oscillations in sensory and motor cortices reflect the encoding of the sensory evidence and motor plan. Large-scale oscillations across widespread cortical networks mediate the integrative processes connecting these local networks: Gamma- and beta-band oscillations across frontal, parietal, and sensory cortices serve the selection of relevant sensory evidence and its flexible mapping onto action plans. In sum, our results suggest that perceptual decisions are mediated by oscillatory interactions within overlapping local and large-scale cortical networks.}

      \field{abstract}{When we respond with one hand, a negative potential can be observed over the motor cortex contralateral to the responding hand. This lateralized readiness potential (LRP) starts even before the response is emitted, and its onset has been taken as a measure of the time at which the brain began preparing to make the response. The LRP has also been used to measure the preliminary activation of a response that is never actually produced. The LRP is a valuable measure of relatively central response activation that is now widely used in many areas of psychology involving reaction time tasks. This chapter discusses the definition of LRP, methods of isolating LRP from other components, brain systems generating the LRP, uses of LRP, and analyses of LRP.}

      \field{abstract}{Working memory (WM) provides the stability necessary for high-level cognition. Influential theories typically assume that WM depends on the persistence of stable neural representations, yet increasing evidence suggests that neural states are highly dynamic. Here we apply multivariate pattern analysis to explore the population dynamics in primate lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) during three variants of the classic memory-guided saccade task (recorded in 4 animals). We observed the hallmark of dynamic population coding across key phases of a working memory task: sensory processing, memory encoding, and response execution. Throughout both these dynamic epochs and the memory delay period, however, the neural representational geometry remained stable. We identified two characteristics that jointly explain these dynamics: (1) time-varying changes in the subpopulation of neurons coding for task variables (i.e., dynamic subpopulations); and (2) time-varying selectivity within neurons (i.e., dynamic selectivity). These results indicate that even in a very simple memory-guided saccade task, PFC neurons display complex dynamics to support stable representations for WM.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTFlexible, intelligent behaviour requires the maintenance and manipulation of incoming information over various time spans. For short time spans, this faculty is labelled 'working memory' (WM). Dominant models propose that WM is maintained by stable, persistent patterns of neural activity in prefrontal cortex (PFC). However, recent evidence suggests that neural activity in PFC is dynamic, even while the contents of WM remain stably represented. Here, we explored the neural dynamics in PFC during a memory-guided saccade task. We found evidence for dynamic population coding in various task epochs, despite striking stability in neural representational geometry of WM. Furthermore, we identified two distinct cellular mechanisms that contribute to dynamic population coding.}

      \field{abstract}{Despite recent advances in uncovering the neural signature of tactile working memory processing in animals and humans, the representation of internally modified somatosensory working memory content has not been studied so far. Here, recording EEG in human participants (n = 25) performing a modified delayed match-to-sample task allowed us to disambiguate internally driven memory processing from encoding-related delay activity. After presentation of two distinct vibrotactile frequencies to different index fingers, a visual cue indicated which of the two previous stimuli had to be maintained in working memory throughout a retention interval for subsequent frequency discrimination against a probe stimulus. During cued stimulus maintenance, $\alpha$ activity (8-13 Hz) over early somatosensory cortices was lateralized according to the cued tactile stimulus, even though the location of the stimuli was task irrelevant. The task-relevant memory content, in contrast, was found to be represented in right prefrontal cortex. The key finding was that the visually presented instructions triggered systematic modulations of prefrontal $\beta$-band activity (20-25 Hz), which selectively reflected the to-be-maintained frequency of the cued tactile vibration. The results expand previous evidence for parametric representations of vibrotactile frequency in the prefrontal cortex and corroborate a central role of dynamic $\beta$-band synchronization during active processing of an analog stimulus quantity in human working memory. In particular, our findings suggest that such processing supports not only sustained maintenance but also purposeful modification and updating of the task-relevant working memory contents.}

      \field{abstract}{Previous studies of delayed-match-to-sample (DMTS) frequency discrimination in animals and humans have succeeded in delineating the neural signature of frequency processing in somatosensory working memory (WM). During retention of vibrotactile frequencies, stimulus-dependent single-cell and population activity in prefrontal cortex was found to reflect the task-relevant memory content, whereas increases in occipital alpha activity signaled the disengagement of areas not relevant for the tactile task. Here, we recorded EEG from human participants to determine the extent to which these mechanisms can be generalized to frequency retention in the visual and auditory domains. Subjects performed analogous variants of a DMTS frequency discrimination task, with the frequency information presented either visually, auditorily, or by vibrotactile stimulation. Examining oscillatory EEG activity during frequency retention, we found characteristic topographical distributions of alpha power over visual, auditory, and somatosensory cortices, indicating systematic patterns of inhibition and engagement of early sensory areas, depending on stimulus modality. The task-relevant frequency information, in contrast, was found to be represented in right prefrontal cortex, independent of presentation mode. In each of the three modality conditions, parametric modulations of prefrontal upper beta activity (20-30 Hz) emerged, in a very similar manner as recently found in vibrotactile tasks. Together, the findings corroborate a view of parametric WM as supramodal internal scaling of abstract quantity information and suggest strong relevance of previous evidence from vibrotactile work for a more general framework of quantity processing in human working memory.}

      \field{abstract}{Numerosity can be assessed by analog estimation, similar to a continuous magnitude, or by discrete quantification of the individual items in a set. While the extent to which these two processes rely on common neural mechanisms remains debated, recent studies of sensory working memory (WM) have identified an oscillatory signature of continuous magnitude information, in terms of quantitative modulations of prefrontal upper beta activity (20-30 Hz). Here, we examined how such parametric oscillatory WM activity may also reflect the abstract assessment of the numerosity of discrete items. We recorded EEG while participants (n = 24) processed the number of stimulus pulses presented in the visual, auditory, or tactile modality, under otherwise identical experimental conditions. Behavioral response profiles showed varying degrees of analog estimation and of discretized quantification in the different modalities. During sustained processing in WM, the amplitude of posterior alpha oscillations (8-13 Hz) reflected the increased memory load associated with maintaining larger sets of discrete items. In contrast, earlier numerosity-dependent modulations of right prefrontal upper beta (20-30 Hz) specifically reflected the extent to which numerosity was assessed by analog estimation, both between and within presentation modalities. Together, the analog approximation-but not the discretized representation-of numerosity information exhibited a parametric oscillatory signature akin to a continuous sensory magnitude. The results suggest dissociable oscillatory mechanisms of abstract numerosity integration, at a supramodal processing stage in human WM.}

      \field{abstract}{Among the rhythms of the brain, oscillations in the beta frequency range (?13–30 Hz) have been considered the most enigmatic. Traditionally associated with sensorimotor functions, beta oscillations have recently become more broadly implicated in top-down processing, long-range communication, and preservation of the current brain state. Here, we extend and refine these views based on accumulating new findings of content-specific beta-synchronization during endogenous information processing in working memory (WM) and decision making. We characterize such content- specific beta activity as short-lived, flexible network dynamics supporting the endogenous (re)activation of cortical representations. Specifically, we suggest that beta-mediated ensemble formation within and between cortical areas may awake, rather than merely preserve, an endogenous cognitive set in the service of current task demands. This proposal accommodates key aspects of content-specific beta modulations in monkeys and humans, integrates with timely computational models, and outlines a functional role for beta that fits its transient temporal characteristics.}

      \field{abstract}{Previous animal research has revealed neuronal activity underlying short-term retention of vibrotactile stimuli, providing evidence for a parametric representation of stimulus frequency in primate tactile working memory (Romo et al., 1999). Here, we investigated the neural correlates of vibrotactile frequency processing in human working memory, using noninvasive electroencephalography (EEG). Participants judged the frequencies of vibrotactile stimuli delivered to the fingertip in a delayed match-to-sample frequency discrimination task. As expected, vibrotactile stimulation elicited pronounced steady-state evoked potentials, which were source-localized in primary somatosensory cortex. Furthermore, parametric analysis of induced EEG responses revealed that the frequency of stimulation was reflected by systematic modulations of synchronized oscillatory activity in nonprimary cortical areas. Stimulus processing was accompanied by frequency-dependent alpha-band responses (8-12 Hz) over dorsal occipital cortex. The critical new finding was that, throughout the retention interval, the stimulus frequency held in working memory was systematically represented by a modulation in prefrontal beta activity (20-25 Hz), which was source-localized to the inferior frontal gyrus. This modulation in oscillatory activity during stimulus retention was related to successful frequency discrimination, thus reflecting behaviorally relevant information. Together, the results complement previous findings of parametric working memory correlates in nonhuman primates and suggest that the quantitative representation of vibrotactile frequency in sensory memory entails systematic modulations of synchronized neural activity in human prefrontal cortex.}

      \field{abstract}{Vertex potentials were recorded from eight Ss performing in an auditory threshold detection task with rating scale responses. The amplitudes and latencies of both the N1 and the late positive (P3) components were found to vary systematically with the criterion level of the decision. These changes in the waveshape of the N1 component were comparable to those produced by varying the signal intensity in a passive condition, but the late positive component in the active task was not similarly related to the passively evoked P2 component It was suggested that the Nl and P3 components represent distinctive aspects of the decision process, with N1 signifying the quantity of signal information received and P3 reflecting the certainty of the decision based upon that information.}

      \field{abstract}{What are the neural mechanisms underlying working memory (WM)? One influential theory posits that neurons in the lateral prefrontal cortex (lPFC) store WM information via persistent activity. In this review, we critically evaluate recent findings that together indicate that this model of WM needs revision. We argue that sensory cortex, not the lPFC, maintains high-fidelity representations of WM content. By contrast, the lPFC simultaneously maintains representations of multiple goal-related variables that serve to bias stimulus-specific activity in sensory regions. This work highlights multiple neural mechanisms supporting WM, including temporally dynamic population coding in addition to persistent activity. These new insights focus the question on understanding how the mechanisms that underlie WM are related, interact, and are coordinated in the lPFC and sensory cortex. {©} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.}

      \field{abstract}{Working memory (WM) provides the functional backbone to high-level cognition. Maintenance in WM is often assumed to depend on the stationary persistence of neural activity patterns that represent memory content. However, accumulating evidence suggests that persistent delay activity does not always accompany WM maintenance but instead seems to wax and wane as a function of the current task relevance of memoranda. Furthermore, new methods for measuring and analysing population-level patterns show that activity states are highly dynamic. At first glance, these dynamics seem at odds with the very nature of WM. How can we keep a stable thought in mind while brain activity is constantly changing? This review considers how neural dynamics might be functionally important for WM maintenance.}

      \field{abstract}{Cognitive flexibility is fundamental to adaptive intelligent behavior. Prefrontal cortex has long been associated with flexible cognitive function, but the neurophysiological principles that enable prefrontal cells to adapt their response properties according to context-dependent rules remain poorly understood. Here, we use time-resolved population-level neural pattern analyses to explore how context is encoded and maintained in primate prefrontal cortex and used in flexible decision making. We show that an instruction cue triggers a rapid series of state transitions before settling into a stable low-activity state. The postcue state is differentially tuned according to the current task-relevant rule. During decision making, the response to a choice stimulus is characterized by an initial stimulus-specific population response but evolves to different final decision-related states depending on the current rule. These results demonstrate how neural tuning profiles in prefrontal cortex adapt to accommodate changes in behavioral context. Highly flexible tuning could be mediated via short-term synaptic plasticity}

      \field{abstract}{Theories of working memory typically assume that information is maintained via persistent neural activity. By contrast, Lundqvist et al. report that single-trial delay activity is actually 'bursty'; the classic profile of persistent activity is an artefact of trial-wise averaging. Tackling brain-behaviour relationships at the single-trial level is an important future direction for cognitive neuroscience.}

      \field{abstract}{It was our purpose in the studies described in this paper to combine two experimental designs which differ remarkably in method, and in their historical and conceptual development, but which in a larger context have as a common aim the understanding of sensory performance and its relevant neural mechanisms (30). Electrophysiological studies, particularly with the method of single-unit analysis, can now provide precise measures of the neural encoding in first-order nerve fibers of the parameters of peripheral stimuli, and of the successive relay and transformation of that neural replication from periphery to cerebral cortex. They have so far provided little understanding of those cerebral mechanisms which, operating upon the transformed replication of the peripheral event in the primary receiving areas of the cerebral cortex, are thought to lead to subjective sensory experience and its overt behavioral counterparts. Psychophysical studies, on the other hand, seek to establish lawful relations between those experiences and certain physical aspects of the stimuli which evoke them.}

      \field{abstract}{This paper is concerned with the human observer's behavior in detecting light signals in a uniform light background. Detection of these signals depends on information transmitted to cortical centers by way of the visual pathways. An analysis is made of the form of this information, and the types of decisions which can be based on information of this form. Based on this analysis, the expected form of data collected in 'yes-no' and 'forced-choice' psychophysical experiments is defined, and experiments demonstrating the internal consistency of the theory are presented.}

      \field{abstract}{1. The latency between the appearance of a popout search display and the eye movement to the oddball target of the display varies from trial to trial in both humans and monkeys. The source of the delay and variability of reaction time is unknown but has been attributed to as yet poorly defined decision processes. 2. We recorded neural activity in the frontal eye field (FEF), an area regarded as playing a central role in producing purposeful eye movements, of monkeys (Macaca mulatta) performing a popout visual search task. Eighty-four neurons with visually evoked activity were analyzed. Twelve of these neurons had a phasic response associated with the presentation of the visual stimulus. The remaining neurons had more tonic responses that persisted through the saccade. Many of the neurons with more tonic responses resembled visuomovement cells in that they had activity that increased before a saccade into their response field. 3. The visual response latencies of FEF neurons were determined with the use of a Poisson spike train analysis. The mean visual latency was 67 ms (minimum = 35 ms, maximum = 138 ms). The visual response latencies to the target presented alone, to the target presented with distractors, or to the distractors did not differ significantly. 4. The initial visual activation of FEF neurons does not discriminate the target from the distractors of a popout visual search stimulus array, but the activity evolves to a state that discriminates whether the target of the search display is within the receptive field. We tested the hypothesis that the source of variability of saccade latency is the time taken by neurons involved in saccade programming to select the target for the gaze shift. 5. With the use of an analysis adapted from signal detection theory, we determined when the activity of single FEF neurons can reliably indicate whether the target or distractors are present within their response fields. The time of target discrimination partitions the reaction time into a perceptual stage in which target discrimination takes place, and a motor stage in which saccade programming and generation take place. The time of target discrimination occurred most often between 120 and 150 ms after stimulus presentation. 6. We analyzed the time course of target discrimination in the activity of single cells after separating trials into short, medium, and long saccade latency groups. Saccade latency was not correlated with the duration of the perceptual stage but was correlated with the duration of the motor stage. This result is inconsistent with the hypothesis that the time taken for target discrimination, as indexed by FEF neurons, accounts for the wide variability in the time of movement initiation. 7. We conclude that the variability observed in saccade latencies during a simple visual search task is largely due to postperceptual motor processing following target discrimination. Signatures of both perceptual and postperceptual processing are evident in FEF. Procrastination in the output stage may prevent stereotypical behavior that would be maladaptive in a changing environment.}

      \field{abstract}{Objective: The steady-state somatosensory evoked potentials (S-SEPs) to vibratory stimulation were recorded to characterize their physiological properties.Methods: Vibratory stimuli were applied to the right palmar surface in 10 normal subjects. A total of 200 responses were recorded from electrodes at 2 cm posterior to C3, Cz and C4 and 2 cm anterior to C3. All responses were Fourier analyzed and the amplitudes of the first (1F) and second (2F) harmonic components were thus obtained. The effects of modulation frequency (5-30 Hz) and stimulus intensity (0.001-0.1 Newton (N)) on S-SEPs were studied.Results: The amplitudes of 1F and 2F were greatest at the electrode 2 cm posterior to C3, 1F being predominant. The mean 1F amplitudes as a function of modulation frequency showed a bimodal distribution with a trough at 14 Hz and a peak at 21 Hz. The mean 1F amplitudes showed a linear increase of up to 0.05 N and thereafter reached a plateau against the logarithmic stimulus intensity axis.Conclusion: Vibratory S-SEPs may originate from the primary somatosensory cortex and provide information on the fast-adapting mechanoreceptive afferents. The temporal resonance at 21 Hz places the somatosensory system between the visual and auditory systems. Copyright (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.}

      \field{abstract}{At any instant, our visual system allows us to perceive a rich and detailed visual world. Yet our internal, explicit representation of this visual world is extremely sparse: we can only hold in mind a minute fraction of the visual scene. These mental representations are stored in visual short-term memory (VSTM). Even though VSTM is essential for the execution of a wide array of perceptual and cognitive functions, and is supported by an extensive network of brain regions, its storage capacity is severely limited. With the use of functional magnetic resonance imaging, we show here that this capacity limit is neurally reflected in one node of this network: activity in the posterior parietal cortex is tightly correlated with the limited amount of scene information that can be stored in VSTM. These results suggest that the posterior parietal cortex is a key neural locus of our impoverished mental representation of the visual world.}

      \field{abstract}{Humans show a severe capacity limit in the number of objects they can store in visual short-term memory (VSTM). We recently demonstrated with functional magnetic resonance imaging that VSTM storage capacity estimated in averaged group data correlated strongly with posterior parietal/superior occipital cortex activity (Todd {\&} Marois, 2004). However, individuals varied widely in their VSTM capacity. Here, we examined the neural basis of these individual differences. A voxelwise, individual-differences analysis revealed a significant correlation between posterior parietal cortex (PPC) activity and individuals' VSTM storage capacity. In addition, a region-of-interest analysis indicated that other brain regions, particularly visual occipital cortex, may contribute to individual differences in VSTM capacity. Thus, although not ruling out contributions from other brain regions, the individual-differences approach supports a key role for the PPC in VSTM by demonstrating that its activity level predicts individual differences in VSTM storage capacity.}

      \field{abstract}{UNLABELLED Electrophysiological research has isolated neural signatures of decision formation in a variety of brain regions. Studies in rodents and monkeys have focused primarily on effector-selective signals that translate the emerging decision into a specific motor plan, but, more recently, research on the human brain has identified an abstract signature of evidence accumulation that does not appear to play any direct role in action preparation. The functional dissociations between these distinct signal types have only begun to be characterized, and their dynamics during decisions with deferred actions with or without foreknowledge of stimulus-effector mapping, a commonly studied task scenario in single-unit and functional imaging investigations, have not been established. Here we traced the dynamics of distinct abstract and effector-selective decision signals in the form of the broad-band centro-parietal positivity (CPP) and limb-selective $\beta$-band (8-16 and 18-30 Hz) EEG activity, respectively, during delayed-reported motion direction decisions with and without foreknowledge of direction-response mapping. With foreknowledge, the CPP and $\beta$-band signals exhibited a similar gradual build-up following evidence onset, but whereas choice-predictive $\beta$-band activity persisted up until the delayed response, the CPP dropped toward baseline after peaking. Without foreknowledge, the CPP exhibited identical dynamics, whereas choice-selective $\beta$-band activity was eliminated. These findings highlight qualitative functional distinctions between effector-selective and abstract decision signals and are of relevance to the assumptions founding functional neuroimaging investigations of decision-making. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Neural signatures of evidence accumulation have been isolated in numerous brain regions. Although animal neurophysiology has largely concentrated on effector-selective decision signals that translate the emerging decision into a specific motor plan, recent research on the human brain has isolated abstract neural signatures of decision formation that are independent of specific sensory and motor requirements. Here, we examine the functional distinctions between the two distinct classes of decision variable signal during decisions with deferred actions with and without foreknowledge of stimulus-effector mapping. We find salient distinctions in the dynamics of abstract versus effector-selective decision signals in the human brain, in terms of sustainment through response delays and contingency on foreknowledge of stimulus-response mapping.}

      \field{abstract}{The P300 component of the human event-related potential has been the subject of intensive experimental investigation across a five-decade period, owing to its apparent relevance to a wide range of cognitive functions and its sensitivity to numerous brain disorders, yet its exact contribution to cognition remains unresolved. Here, we carry out key analyses of the P300 elicited by transient auditory and visual targets to examine its potential role as a 'decision variable' signal that accumulates evidence to a decision bound. Consistent with the latter, we find that the P300 reaches a stereotyped amplitude immediately prior to response execution and that its rate of rise scales with target detection difficulty and accounts for trial-to-trial variance in RT.

Thus, where the dominant explanatory accounts have conceived of the P300 as a unitary neural event, our data reveal it to be a dynamically evolving neural signature of decision formation. These findings place the P300 at the heart of a mechanistically principled framework for understanding decision-making in both the typical and atypical human brain.}

      \field{abstract}{Brain activity in frontal regions has been found to represent frequency information with a parametric code during working memory delay phases. The mental representation of frequencies has furthermore been shown to be modality independent in non-human primate electrophysiology and human EEG studies, suggesting frontal regions encoding quantitative information in a supramodal manner. A recent fMRI study using multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) supports an overlapping multimodal network for the maintenance of visual and tactile frequency information over frontal and parietal brain regions. The present study extends the investigation of working memory representation of frequency information to the auditory domain. To this aim, we used MVPA on fMRI data recorded during an auditory frequency maintenance task. A support vector regression analysis revealed working memory information in auditory association areas and, consistent with earlier findings of parametric working memory, in a frontoparietal network. A direct comparison to an analogous dataset of vibrotactile parametric working memory revealed an overlap of information coding in prefrontal regions, particularly in the right inferior frontal gyrus. Therefore, our findings indicate that the prefrontal cortex represents frequency-specific working memory content irrespective of the modality as has been now also revealed for the auditory modality.}

      \field{abstract}{While judging their sensory environments, decision-makers seem to use the uncertainty about their choices to guide adjustments of their subsequent behaviour. One possible source of these behavioural adjustments is arousal: decision uncertainty might drive the brain's arousal systems, which control global brain state and might thereby shape subsequent decision-making. Here, we measure pupil diameter, a proxy for central arousal state, in human observers performing a perceptual choice task of varying difficulty. Pupil dilation, after choice but before external feedback, reflects three hallmark signatures of decision uncertainty derived from a computational model. This increase in pupil-linked arousal boosts observers' tendency to alternate their choice on the subsequent trial. We conclude that decision uncertainty drives rapid changes in pupil-linked arousal state, which shape the serial correlation structure of ongoing choice behaviour.}

      \field{abstract}{Comments on an article, Internal and external influences on the rate of sensory evidence accumulation in the human brain by S. P. Kelly (2013). Kelly and O'Connell (2013) used a variant of a well studied visual motion discrimination task in which observers judge the net direction of visual motion embedded in ongoing dynamic noise. The difficulty of such perceptual decisions can be manipulated by varying the stimulus strength, i.e., the fraction of dots moving in the same direction. In the classical version of this task, stimulus onset evokes strong transients in the EEG signal that are unrelated to the decision process. By displaying a constant stream of dynamic noise that changes to coherent motion at target onset, Kelly and O'Connell eliminated these visual transients from the data. Kelly and O'Connell report a neural signal that meets several criteria of a theoretically predicted DV, while additionally being independent of a specific motor response. While future studies need to pinpoint the exact functional significance of the CPP, the report by Kelly and O'Connell adds to a growing body of work in human electrophysiology revealing neural dynamics of perceptual decision-making.

      \field{abstract}{The time course of perceptual choice is discussed in a model of gradual, leaky, stochastic, and competitive information accumulation in nonlinear decision units. Special cases of the model match a classical diffusion process, but leakage and competition work together to address several challenges to existing diffusion, random walk, and accumulator models. The model accounts for data from choice tasks using both time-controlled (e.g., response signal) and standard reaction time paradigms and its adequacy compares favorably with other approaches. A new paradigm that controls the time of arrival of information supporting different choice alternatives provides further support. The model captures choice behavior regardless of the number of alternatives, accounting for the log-linear relation between reaction time and number of alternatives (Hick's law) and explains a complex pattern of visual and contextual priming in visual word identification.}

      \field{abstract}{The primate visual system contains dozens of distinct areas in the cerebral cortex and several major subcortical structures. These subdivisions are extensively interconnected in a distributed hierarchical network that contains several intertwined processing streams. A number of strategies are used for efficient information processing within this hierarchy. These include linear and nonlinear filtering, passage through information bottlenecks, and coordinated use of multiple types of information. In addition, dynamic regulation of information flow within and between visual areas may provide the computational flexibility needed for the visual system to perform a broad spectrum of tasks accurately and at high resolution.}

      \field{abstract}{The location, topographic organization, and function of the middle temporal visual area (MT) in the macaque monkey was studied using anatomical and physiological techniques. MT is a small, elliptically shaped area on the posterior bank of the superior temporal sulcus which can be identified by its direct inputs from striate cortex and by its distinctive pattern of heavy myelination. Its average surface area is 33 mm2, which is less than 3{\%} of the size of striate cortex. It contains a complete, topographically organized representation of the contralateral visual hemifield. There are substantial irregularities in the detailed pattern of topographic organization, however, and the representation is significantly more complex than that found for MT in other primates. Much of MT is devoted to the representation of central visual fields, with the emphasis on central vision being similar to that found in striate cortex. Electrophysiological recordings have confirmed previous reports of a high incidence of direction selective cells in MT. The transition in functional properties, from cells lacking direction selectivity outside MT to direction selective cells within, occurs over a distance of 0.1-0.2 mm or less along the lateral border of MT. Such a transition does not occur along the medial border, however, as the cortex medial to MT contains many cells with strong direction selectivity. Nevertheless, this region differs from MT in its myeloarchitecture, its lack of inputs from striate cortex, and the large size of its receptive fields. These results demonstrate the existence of three distinct visual areas on the posterior bank of the superior temporal sulcus which can be distinguished on the basis of both physiological and anatomical criteria.}

      \field{abstract}{The emergence of a unified cognitive moment relies on the coordination of scattered mosaics of functionally specialized brain regions. Here we review the mechanisms of large-scale integration that counterbalance the distributed anatomical and functional organization of brain activity to enable the emergence of coherent behaviour and cognition. Although the mechanisms involved in large-scale integration are still largely unknown, we argue that the most plausible candidate is the formation of dynamic links mediated by synchrony over multiple frequency bands.}

      \field{abstract}{Neurons in the cortex exhibit a number of patterns that correlate with working memory. Specifically, averaged across trials of working memory tasks, neurons exhibit different firing rate patterns during the delay of those tasks. These patterns include: 1) persistent fixed-frequency elevated rates above baseline, 2) elevated rates that decay throughout the tasks memory period, 3) rates that accelerate throughout the delay, and 4) patterns of inhibited firing (below baseline) analogous to each of the preceding excitatory patterns. Persistent elevated rate patterns are believed to be the neural correlate of working memory retention and preparation for execution of behavioral/motor responses as required in working memory tasks. Models have proposed that such activity corresponds to stable attractors in cortical neural networks with fixed synaptic weights. However, the variability in patterned behavior and the firing statistics of real neurons across the entire range of those behaviors across and within trials of working memory tasks are typical not reproduced. Here we examine the effect of dynamic synapses and network architectures with multiple cortical areas on the states and dynamics of working memory networks. The analysis indicates that the multiple pattern types exhibited by cells in working memory networks are inherent in networks with dynamic synapses, and that the variability and firing statistics in such networks with distributed architectures agree with that observed in the cortex.}

      \field{abstract}{Working memory, a well-studied cognitive function, refers to the capacity to remember things for a short time. Which neurons in the brain implement this function and how exactly they do it are unresolved questions. Here we show that, in a cortical area that participates in the analysis of perceptual experiences, the same neurons encode both tactile and acoustic information in working memory, and do so using the same representation for both modalities. This means that memory circuits in this area are dedicated to encoding information in a relatively abstract format that had not been revealed until now.}

      \field{abstract}{Frequency-specific oscillations and phase-coupling of neuronal populations have been proposed as an essential mechanism for the coordination of activity between brain areas during cognitive tasks. To provide an effective substrate for cognitive function, we reasoned that ongoing functional brain networks should also be able to reorganize and coordinate in a similar manner. To test this hypothesis, we here use a novel method for identifying repeating patterns of network dynamics, and show that resting networks in magnetoencephalography are well characterised by visits to short-lived transient brain states ({\~{}}50-100ms), with spatially distinct power and phase-coupling in specific frequency bands. Brain states were identified for sensory, motor networks and higher-order cognitive networks; these include a posterior cognitive network in the alpha range (8-12Hz) and an anterior cognitive network in the delta/theta range (1-7Hz). Both cognitive networks exhibit particularly high power and coherence, and contain brain areas corresponding to posterior and anterior subdivisions of the default mode network. Our results show that large-scale cortical phase-coupling networks operate in very specific frequency bands, possibly reflecting functional specialisation at different intrinsic timescales.}

      \field{abstract}{The brain is capable of producing coordinated fast changing neural dynamics across multiple brain regions in order to adapt to rapidly changing environments. However, it is non-trivial to identify multiregion dynamics at fast sub-second time-scales in electrophysiological data. We propose a method that, with no knowledge of any task timings, can simultaneously identify and describe fast transient multiregion dynamics in terms of their temporal, spectral and spatial properties. The approach models brain activity using a discrete set of sequential states, with each state distinguished by its own multiregion spectral properties. This can identify potentially very short-lived visits to a brain state, at the same time as inferring the state's properties, by pooling over many repeated visits to that state. We show how this can be used to compute state-specific measures such as power spectra and coherence. We demonstrate that this can be used to identify short-lived transient brain states with distinct power and functional connectivity (e.g., coherence) properties in an MEG data set collected during a volitional motor task.}

Persistent firing arises from recurrent excitation within a network of pyramidal Delay cells. Here, we examined glutamate receptor influences underlying persistent firing in primate dlPFC during a spatial working memory task. Computational models predicted dependence on NMDA receptor (NMDAR) NR2B stimulation, and Delay cell persistent firing was abolished by local NR2B NMDAR blockade or by systemic ketamine administration. AMPA receptors (AMPARs) contributed background depolarization to sustain network firing. In contrast, many Response cells were sensitive to AMPAR blockade and increased firing after systemic ketamine, indicating that models of ketamine actions should be refined to reflect neuronal heterogeneity. The reliance of Delay cells on NMDAR may explain why insults to NMDARs in schizophrenia or Alzheimer@s disease profoundly impair cognition}

      \field{abstract}{Synchronous rhythms represent a core mechanism for sculpting temporal coordination of neural activity in the brain-wide network. This review focuses on oscillations in the cerebral cortex that occur during cognition, in alert behaving conditions. Over the last two decades, experimental and modeling work has made great strides in elucidating the detailed cellular and circuit basis of these rhythms, particularly gamma and theta rhythms. The underlying physiological mechanisms are diverse (ranging from resonance and pacemaker properties of single cells to multiple scenarios for population synchronization and wave propagation), but also exhibit unifying principles. A major conceptual advance was the realization that synaptic inhibition plays a fundamental role in rhythmogenesis, either in an interneuronal network or in a reciprocal excitatory-inhibitory loop. Computational functions of synchronous oscillations in cognition are still a matter of debate among systems neuroscientists, in part because the notion of regular oscillation seems to contradict the common observation that spiking discharges of individual neurons in the cortex are highly stochastic and far from being clocklike. However, recent findings have led to a framework that goes beyond the conventional theory of coupled oscillators and reconciles the apparent dichotomy between irregular single neuron activity and field potential oscillations. From this perspective, a plethora of studies will be reviewed on the involvement of long-distance neuronal coherence in cognitive functions such as multisensory integration, working memory, and selective attention. Finally, implications of abnormal neural synchronization are discussed as they relate to mental disorders like schizophrenia and autism.}

      \field{abstract}{Although the electroencephalogram (EEG) is widely used in research and clinical settings, its link to the underlying neural activity during sensory processing remains poorly understood. To investigate this, we made simultaneous recordings of surface EEG, intracortical local field potential, and multiunit activity (MUA) in the alert monkey visual cortex during presentation of natural movies. Using a general linear model, we show that in single trials, EEG power in the gamma band (30-100 Hz) and phase in delta band (2-4 Hz) are significant predictors of the MUA response. Specifically, we found that the MUA response was strongest only when increases in EEG gamma power occurred during the negative-going phase of the delta wave, thus revealing a frequency-band coupling mechanism that can be exploited to infer population spiking activity. This finding may open up a new dimension in the use and interpretation of EEG in normal and pathological conditions. {©} 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}

      \field{abstract}{UNLABELLED Neuronal activity in the lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) reflects the structure and cognitive demands of memory-guided sensory discrimination tasks. However, we still do not know how neuronal activity articulates in network states involved in perceiving, remembering, and comparing sensory information during such tasks. Oscillations in local field potentials (LFPs) provide fingerprints of such network dynamics. Here, we examined LFPs recorded from LPFC of macaques while they compared the directions or the speeds of two moving random-dot patterns, S1 and S2, separated by a delay. LFP activity in the theta, beta, and gamma bands tracked consecutive components of the task. In response to motion stimuli, LFP theta and gamma power increased, and beta power decreased, but showed only weak motion selectivity. In the delay, LFP beta power modulation anticipated the onset of S2 and encoded the task-relevant S1 feature, suggesting network dynamics associated with memory maintenance. After S2 onset the difference between the current stimulus S2 and the remembered S1 was strongly reflected in broadband LFP activity, with an early sensory-related component proportional to stimulus difference and a later choice-related component reflecting the behavioral decision buildup. Our results demonstrate that individual LFP bands reflect both sensory and cognitive processes engaged independently during different stages of the task. This activation pattern suggests that during elementary cognitive tasks, the prefrontal network transitions dynamically between states and that these transitions are characterized by the conjunction of LFP rhythms rather than by single LFP bands. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Neurons in the brain communicate through electrical impulses and coordinate this activity in ensembles that pulsate rhythmically, very much like musical instruments in an orchestra. These rhythms change with "brain state," from sleep to waking, but also signal with different oscillation frequencies rapid changes between sensory and cognitive processing. Here, we studied rhythmic electrical activity in the monkey prefrontal cortex, an area implicated in working memory, decision making, and executive control. Monkeys had to identify and remember a visual motion pattern and compare it to a second pattern. We found orderly transitions between rhythmic activity where the same frequency channels were active in all ongoing prefrontal computations. This supports prefrontal circuit dynamics that transitions rapidly between complex rhythmic patterns during structured cognitive tasks.}

      \field{abstract}{Previous working memory (WM) research based on non-human primate electrophysiology and human EEG has shown that frontal brain regions maintain frequencies of flutter stimulation across different sensory modalities by means of a supramodal parametric WM code. These findings imply that frontal regions encode the memorized frequencies in a sensory-unspecific, quantitative format. Here, we explored which brain regions maintain information about frequencies provided by different sensory modalities at the level of activity pattern across fMRI voxel populations. Moreover, we sought evidence for a supramodal multivariate WM representation. Participants maintained the same set of frequencies of tactile vibration and visual flicker for a 6 s WM delay in a frequency discrimination task. A support vector regression model for multivariate pattern analysis was applied. We observed that sensory cortices were only selective for memoranda of their corresponding modalities, while frontoparietal regions exhibited distinguishable activity patterns to memorized frequencies regardless of sensory modality. A common multivariate code was not evident in our data. Collectively, we show that mnemonic representations for stimulus frequencies are maintained throughout the cortical hierarchy, in line with the suggested transformation of information across different representational formats. Although evidence for a supramodal multivariate code is absent, our findings underpin the generalized role of the frontoparietal cortex for maintaining quantitative information across sensory modalities.}

      \field{abstract}{Using visual information to guide behaviour requires storage in a temporary buffer, known as visual short-term memory (VSTM), that sustains attended information across saccades and other visual interruptions. There is growing debate on whether VSTM capacity is limited to a fixed number of objects or whether it is variable. Here we report four experiments using functional magnetic resonance imaging that resolve this controversy by dissociating the representation capacities of the parietal and occipital cortices. Whereas representations in the inferior intra-parietal sulcus (IPS) are fixed to about four objects at different spatial locations regardless of object complexity, those in the superior IPS and the lateral occipital complex are variable, tracking the number of objects held in VSTM, and representing fewer than four objects as their complexity increases. These neural response patterns were observed during both VSTM encoding and maintenance. Thus, multiple systems act together to support VSTM: whereas the inferior IPS maintains spatial attention over a fixed number of objects at different spatial locations, the superior IPS and the lateral occipital complex encode and maintain a variable subset of the attended objects, depending on their complexity. VSTM capacity is therefore determined both by a fixed number of objects and by object complexity.}

      \field{abstract}{Neurons in the middle temporal visual area (MT) have been implicated in the perception of visual motion, whereas prefrontal cortex (PFC) neurons have been linked to temporary storage of sensory signals, attentional and executive control of behavior. Using a task that placed demands on both sets of neurons, we investigated their contribution to working memory for visual motion. Monkeys compared the direction of two moving random-dot stimuli, sample and test, separated by a brief memory delay. Neurons in both areas showed robust direction-selective activity during all phases of the task. During the sample, approximately 60{\%} of task-related PFC neurons were direction selective, and this selectivity emerged 40 ms later than in MT. Unlike MT, the PFC responses to sample did not correlate with behavioral choices, but their selectivity was modulated by task demands and diminished on error trials. Reliable directional signals were found in both areas during the memory delay, but these signals were transient rather than sustained by neurons of either area. Responses to the test in both areas were modulated by the remembered sample direction, decreasing when the test direction matched the sample. This decrease arose in the PFC 100 ms later than in MT and was predictive of the forthcoming decision. Our data suggest that neurons in the two regions are functionally connected and make unique contributions to different task components. PFC neurons reflect task-related information about visual motion and represent decisions that may be based, in part, on the comparison in MT between the remembered sample and test.}

      \field{abstract}{1. Anatomical studies have shown the cortex of the posterior bank of the superior temporal sulcus to receive a projection from visual cortical areas, including areas 17, 18 and 19. In this paper the response of single neurones in this area to simple visual stimulation is reported. Ten monkeys were studied.2. A clear but relatively crude topographic representation of the visual field was found. There was a large variation in the size of the receptive fields of individual cells, even in a single penetration. Some cells, with the central parts of their receptive fields located from between 1 and 5 degrees from the centre of gaze had receptive fields averaging about 10 degrees x 10 degrees or even larger. Other cells with central receptive fields had much smaller field sizes.3. Two main types of neurones were encountered, with subdivisions within each type. The first type responded to movement irrespective of form. These could be subdivided into neurones which responded to movement in any direction within the receptive field and neurones which responded to movement in one direction only (directionally selective neurones). Another type of cell was responsive to both contour and movement, much like the complex and lower order hypercomplex cells. Almost all such neurones were directionally selective.4. In oblique penetrations through this cortical region, there tended frequently to be an orderly shift in preferred directions of motion, thus suggesting the possibility of a columnar organization for movement.5. Combined anatomical (degeneration) and electrophysiological experiments showed that these types of neurones are found in those regions of the posterior bank of the superior temporal sulcus receiving a direct projection from area 17.}

      \field{abstract}{To support an Oak Ridge National Laboratory programs exoskeleton project, a unique multi-axis foot force/torque sensor was constructed and tested that has biomedical application such as clinical gait analysis. The challenging aspect of this multi-axis force sensor is that it had to conform to the bending of the human foot, withstand high impact loads, have high force sensitivity, feel comfortable to the human wearer, be integrated into a military style boot, measure the forces on the human foot when either the ball or the heel of the foot is in contact with the ground, respond to both positive and negative loading and have a low overall height and weight. This paper describes the design and testing of this unique sensor.}

      \field{abstract}{It is shown that visuo-spatial working memory is better characterized as processes operating on sensory information (visual appearance) and on spatial location (environmental coordinates) in a distributed network than as unitary slave system. Results from passive (short-term) and active memory tasks (imagery) disclose the properties (capacity, content) and the components of this network. The prefrontal cortex is a control structure (dorsal prefers active, ventral passive tasks) and it contributes to spatial memory by a prospective spatial code (eye movements). Visual appearance (including dynamic aspects) is represented as features and object files (bound features) within content-specific areas in the ventral occipital cortex. Spatial coordinates are represented in the parietal cortex (modality-unspecific), when used in spatio-temporal tasks (Corsi) they are closely related to attention. Imagery of objects activates occipito-temporal structures, spatial transformations and mental rotation the parietal cortex (specifically the intraparietal sulcus). Perception, working memory, and imagery use the same neural network. Differences between the tasks are explained by different demands and states of the neural network, and differences in the configuration of the anterior-posterior neural circuits. {©} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
